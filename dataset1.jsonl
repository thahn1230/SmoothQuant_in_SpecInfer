August Dupin’s needling repartee with the Parisian police in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Purloined Letter” to Sherlock Holmes’s insinuating banter with Lestrade, Hercule Poirot’s passive-aggressive one-upmanship with Chief Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard, hard-boiled Sam Spade’s agon with the district attorney in The Maltese Falcon (1930), and Philip Marlowe’s dismissal from the police force for insubordination, detective fiction has always shown the private investigator at odds with official police bureaucracy. It’s one way of dramatizing the messiness of the idea of justice—at once an individual (possibly personal or private) code and at the same time susceptible to a codifying proceduralism (all part of the detective’s “advantage of being unofficial,” as Holmes puts it in Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Silver Blaze” [The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1893), New York, 20]).

{"text": "Q:\n\nPython for Autohotkey style key-combination sniffing, automation?\n\nI want to automate several tasks (eg. simulate eclipse style ctrl-shift-R open dialog for other editors). The general pattern is: the user will press some key combination, my program will detect it and potentially pop up a dialog to get user input, and then run a corresponding command, typically by running an executable.\nMy target environment is windows, although cross-platform would be nice. My program would be started once, read a configuration file, and sit in the background till triggered by a key combination or other event.\nBasically autohotkey.\nWhy not just use autohotkey? I actually have quite a few autohotkey macros, but I'd prefer to use a saner language.\nMy question is: is there a good way to have a background python process detect key combinations?\nUpdate: found the answer using pyHook and the win32 extensions:\nimport pyHook\nimport pythoncom\n\ndef OnKeyboardEvent(event):\n    print event.Ascii\n\nhm = pyHook.HookManager()\nhm.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent\nhm.HookKeyboard()\n\nwhile True:\n    pythoncom.PumpMessages()\n\nA:\n\nYou may want to look at AutoIt.

Additonally, it has COM bindings so you can use most of it's abilities easily in python if you so desired.  I've posted about how to do it here before.\n\nA:\n\nFound the answer using pyHook and the win32 extensions:\nimport pyHook\nimport pythoncom\n\ndef OnKeyboardEvent(event):\n    print event.Ascii\n\nhm = pyHook.HookManager()\nhm.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent\nhm.HookKeyboard()\n\nwhile True:\n    pythoncom.PumpMessages()\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Choosing to Enter God's Presence\n\nPsalm 65:1-13 It was a cold wintry day, and someone was knocking violently at my door. I looked through the peephole to discover two frightened young ladies who seemed desperate. Then I heard dogs barking in the background. I opened the door, and they said, \"Please let us in!! Some dogs are chasing us!!\" They were going door to door selling magazines, and some neighborhood dogs were following them. I let them in quickly, and they ended up staying with me for two hours. They were so relieved to find a refuge in my home. After some conversation and some hot tea, one of the ladies asked, \"Don't you get lonely in this big house?\" My husband was at work, and my children were at school. I answered, \"No, I never get lonely because the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are always with me, and we have a tea party every day.\" Suddenly one of the ladies said with urgency in her voice, \"We've got to go now.\" I guess they thought I was crazy, but at least my statement finally made them leave.\n\nThis incident reminds me of the times I have chosen to enter God's presence, His dwelling place, just to find refuge and comfort because I am desperate. So often I neglect my quiet times in the morning when things are going well in my life, but I would not dream of missing time with the Lord when I am going through hard times.\n\nThis psalm speaks of the blessing that awaits those who approach God. \"Blessed is the man You choose and cause to approach unto You, that he may dwell in Your courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, of Your holy temple\" (v. 4).\n\nNote it was God who chose and caused the man in this psalm to approach Him. This offers hope for me in the discipline of a daily quiet time. Sometimes I just don't feel I have the time to spend alone with the Lord, and frankly sometimes I just don't want to take the time. When those times come in my life now, I can pray this prayer:\n\nMore From Around the Word in 365 Days\n\nYour Turn\n\nPlease be considerate and respectful of your fellow posters.

{"text": "Q:\n\nHow Chrome browser know which client certificate to prompt for a site?\n\nI'm setting up certificate authentication for my project using Tomcat. It works ok for command line client such as cURL.\nI have many client certificates installed in Chrome browser. Some are using to connect to my site, others are used for different purposes and not relate to my project.\nEvery time I connect to my site, Chrome presents a list of client certificates for choosing. These are exactly the certificates that I installed and not others. My questions are:\n\nHow Chrome knows which client certificates are for a site to present for choosing?\nTomcat stores those client certificates in its trust store. During\nSSL hanshake, Tomcat will request for client certificate. Does it\nrequest for some specific certificates that it knows in its trusted\nstore so that Chrome knows what to show?\n\nA:\n\nThe client certificate authentication is ruled in the handshake phase of the SSL/TLS protocol implemented by browsers.\n\nIf the server requires a client certificate authentication (it is\noptional), send a message to client with the list of the accepted\ncertificate authorities (CA). Can be void if server accepts any\ncertificate.  \nThe client select the certificates installed in client keystore which have been issued by any of these CA's, and present the list to user. In case of Chrome, the browser selects the certificates installed by user from the Operative System Key Store. \nUser choose a certificate, and the client performs a signature with the private key of the certificate over a known data interchanged during handshake.\n\nOnly certificates with private key can be selected during step 2. This is the reason by with the browser does not select the certificates of trusted CA's installed in your device. You do not own the private key\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f       In 2008, Richards filed a suit alleging retaliatory discharge by her former\n\nemployer, Centre Area Transportation Authority (CATA). Summary judgment was\n\ngranted in favor of CATA on January 25, 2010. Richards appealed, and we affirmed.\n\nRichards v. Centre Area Transp., No. 10-1586, 414 F. App’x 501 (3d Cir. 2011). Over\n\ntwo years later, Richards filed a motion for relief from the judgment on the basis of\n\nnewly discovered evidence, fraud, and “to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.”\n\nThe District Court denied the motion in large part because it was untimely. See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(c)(1) (one year limitation on new evidence and fraud claims under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b)(1)-(3)). The District Court also held that the proposed new evidence, even if\n\ntimely, would not be a sufficient ground justifying relief.1 Richards moved for\n\nreconsideration, the District Court denied the motion, and this timely appeal followed.\n\n       Summary judgment was granted on the basis that Richards had not shown that\n\nCATA’s stated reasons for firing her were pretextual. The new evidence that Richards\n\nwished to offer concerned a male CATA employee who was disciplined, discharged, but\n\nthen ultimately reinstated. Richards claimed the male employee’s misconduct was\n\nsimilar to that which resulted in her termination. Richards argues that summary judgment\n\nwould not have been granted in CATA’s favor if she had been able show a male\n\ncolleague was treated more favorably.\n\n       “We review grants or denials of relief under Rule 60(b) . . . under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.” Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, 251 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n\n1\n Though the District Court did not cite a particular part of Rule 60 in this discussion, we\nunderstand it to be denying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n                                             2\n\fWe agree with the District Court that Richards’s claims of fraud and new evidence are\n\nuntimely, and we affirm the denial of Rule 60(b) relief on that basis. Motions on the\n\nbasis of newly discovered evidence and fraud must be made within a year of the entry of\n\njudgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Here, judgment was entered on January 25, 2010\n\nand Richards’s motion was filed on March 12, 2013.\n\n       As to the remainder of the District Court’s analysis,2 the District Court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that Richards had not shown anything close to the\n\n“extraordinary circumstances” required to vacate a judgment under Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nBudget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 251 (citation omitted). We note that Richards appears to be\n\nmaking arguments that are best suited for relief under Rule 60(b)(2), but relief under that\n\nsection must be sought within one year from the entry of judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(c)(1). As noted above, the District Court correctly concluded that Richards filed her\n\nmotion too late for consideration under Rule (60(b)(2). Further, Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be\n\nused “as a means by which the time limitations of 60(b)(1)-(3) may be circumvented.”\n\nStradley v. Cortez, 518 F.2d 488, 493 (3d Cir. 1975); see also Arrieta v. Battaglia, 461\n\nF.3d 861, 865 (7th Cir. 2006) (“if the asserted ground for relief falls within one of the\n\nenumerated grounds for relief subject to the one-year time limit of Rule 60(b), relief\n\nunder the residual provision of rule 60(b)(6) is not available.”).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  We note that a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) can also be untimely, as Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 60(c)(1) requires that such a motion be filed “within a reasonable time.” See\nMoolenaar v. Gov’t of V.I., 822 F.2d 1342, 1348 (3d Cir. 1987) (two years was not “a\nreasonable time.”). However, the District Court did not discuss this timeliness issue.\n                                              3\n\f       Even if consideration of Richards’s “new evidence” were possible now, she\n\nwould not prevail. First, Richards never explains when or how she received the “new\n\nevidence” she wishes to use, and, as CATA points out, Richards does not even say\n\nexplicitly that this evidence was not provided in discovery during the case. Second,\n\ndespite Richards’s contention that the new evidence was in a sealed personnel file, no\n\nexplanation is offered for why this evidence would not have been discoverable when she\n\nwas originally litigating this case with the aid of counsel. Third, as the District Court\n\nthoroughly explained, the proposed evidence would not have changed the outcome of the\n\noriginal litigation. The alleged comparator was not “similarly situated” because of the\n\ndifferent “nature of the misconduct engaged in” that formed the articulated reason for\n\ntermination. See Burks v. Wis. Dep’t of Transp., 464 F.3d 744, 751 (7th Cir. 2006)\n\n(holding comparator must be comparable in misconduct). Specifically, as the District\n\nemphasized, the proposed comparator’s misconduct was only a subset of Richards’s. The\n\nDistrict Court noted that there were both fewer incidents of misconduct in the other\n\nemployee’s case and, unlike Richards’s alleged misconduct, an absence of incidents that\n\nsuggested potential violence.\n\n       Richards argues that the District Court should have vacated the judgment against\n\nher because CATA perpetrated a fraud on the court. Whatever the extent of such a power\n\nindependent of Rule 60(b), Richards has come nowhere near the showing requisite for\n\nsuch relief. See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44 (1991) (citing Hazel-Atlas\n\nGlass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944)). The “fraud” she alleges is that\n\nCATA’s reasons for firing her were, in fact, pretextual. See Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d\n\n                                              4\n\f759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994). While a finding that articulated reasons for termination are\n\npretextual certainly looks somewhat like a finding of fraud on the court, they are not the\n\nsame thing. See Herring v. U.S., 424 F.3d 384, 386-87 (3d Cir. 2005) (discussing the\n\nelements of and “demanding standard of proof” for a claim of fraud upon the court).\n\nHere, as appellee argues, Richards has neglected even to allege that the comparison\n\nevidence was even withheld, much less wrongfully so.\n\n       Finally, CATA asks us to impose damages and costs for the filing of a frivolous\n\nappeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. An appeal is deemed frivolous if it\n\nis “wholly without merit.” Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., 943 F.2d 346, 347 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\nThis determination is objective, focusing “on the merits of the appeal regardless of good\n\nor bad faith.” Hilmon Co. v. Hyatt Int’l, 899 F.2d 250, 253 (3d Cir. 1990) (quotation\n\nomitted). Here, the clarity of the timeliness issue puts this case within the category of\n\nfrivolous appeals. However, even where an appeal is frivolous, we have discretion to\n\naward damages. Fed. R. App. P. 38 (“If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is\n\nfrivolous, it may . . . award just damages”) (emphasis added); see also Huck on behalf of\n\nSea Air Shuttle Corp. v. Dawson, 106 F.3d 45, 52 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding an appeal\n\n“frivolous” within the meaning of Fed. R. App. P. 38 without entering any award of\n\ndamages). We would be hesitant to award such damages where, as appellee admits, the\n\nfinancial resources of the appellant are such as to make an award of damages a dead\n\nletter. See Nagle v. Alspach, 8 F.3d 141, 145 (3d Cir. 1993) (stating that discouraging\n\nthe frivolous filer is a motivation for awarding damages for filing a frivolous appeal).\n\nFurther, while we might reach a different result if Richards had filed this appeal with the\n\n                                              5\n\faid of counsel, “an unrepresented litigant should not be punished with damages for [her]\n\nfailure to appreciate subtleties in legal arguments.” Beam v. Bauer, 383 F.3d 106, 109\n\n(3d Cir. 2004) (citing Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 15 (1980)).\n\n             For the reasons given, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\nAppellee’s motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Feeding oleamide to lactating Jersey cows 1. Effects on lactation performance and milk fatty acid composition.\nOleamide was previously reported to resist ruminal biohydrogenation and elevate milk oleic acid concentration when fed to lactating Holstein cows. To determine if Jersey cows responded similarly to oleamide, four lactating Jersey cows (mean 417 kg of body weight and 64 days in milk) were fed four diets in a 4x4 Latin square with 2-wk periods. Diets were total mixed ration containing 47% corn silage and 53% concentrate (dry matter basis) and were supplemented with no added fat (control), or with 3.5% added fat from either higholeic canola oil, a commercial source of oleamide, or oleamide synthesized from oleic acid and urea. The canola oil supplement had no effect on milk yield or composition. Compared to canola oil, the oleamide supplements reduced milk yield, dry matter intake, and milk fat and protein contents. Milk oleic acid concentration increased from 17.4% of total fatty acids for the control diet to 22.1% for the canola oil diet. Both oleamides further increased milk oleic acid to 30.0 and 27.1% of total fatty acids for the commercial and synthesized oleamides, respectively. Milk palmitic acid was reduced and stearic acid was increased by all fat supplements but more so by the oleamides than by the canola oil. Consistent with previous reports that fatty acyl amides resist ruminal biohydrogenation, feeding oleamide to Jersey cows in this study increased milk oleic acid concentration but had negative effects on feed intake and milk yield.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The present invention relates generally to a method for the selective removal of inventoried items.\nThis invention relates generally to devices and systems for controlled dispensing of medications, therapeutic agents, or other pharmaceutical items in a hospital environment, nursing home, or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved security or locking system to be used in combination with existing medication dispenser stations and related methods of operation for providing simple but controlled access to any array of pharmaceutical, medical or therapeutic items concurrently with the generation and maintenance of an accurate, detailed access record. Exemplary systems currently available are Pyxis Remote Manager(trademark) and Medstation(copyright) both of which are manufactured by Pyxis Corporation and MedSelect(copyright) External Lock Modules manufactured by Diebold, Incorporated.\nIn a hospital environment or the like, a large number of pharmaceutical items such as medications, therapeutic agents, syringes, dressings, etc. are used in the course of individualized medical treatment provided to multiple patients. Such pharmaceutical items are normally stocked at a centralized location such as a hospital pharmacy, nursing stations, or the like for periodic distribution to patients. The distribution of pharmaceutical items is tailored to the specific needs of each nursing station, particularly with respect to the individual medical treatment requirements for patients assigned to each nursing station. For example, many medications are typically prescribed by physicians for administration to specific patients according to a particular time schedule. Other medications and pharmaceutical items are normally stocked at the nursing station for use on an as-needed basis.\nAt each nursing station, the pharmaceutical items are stored for access by nursing personnel in accordance with individual patient requirements. In this regard, many items are normally maintained in unlocked storage for easy and substantially unrestricted access, while other items such as narcotic medications are normally retained in locked storage to prevent unauthorized access and theft. For all pharmaceutical items, however, withdrawal of pharmaceutical items from inventory is accompanied by updating of the medication administration record (MAR) for the appropriate patient. In this regard, such record maintenance is an important function of nursing personnel to confirm the treatment regimen for each patient, to insure proper charging of patient accounts, and to permit accurate tracking of the pharmaceutical inventory. Unfortunately, due to the exigencies of a typical nursing environment, the medication records are often incomplete and/or inaccurate. As a result, the inventory of some or all of the pharmaceutical items is regularly checked, such as at the conclusion of each nursing shift, in an effort to reduce recording and/or treatment errors and further to minimize pilferage losses.\nIn recent years, a variety of devices and systems have been proposed in attempts to provide improved inventory control for pharmaceutical items in a hospital environment or the like. Many such devices have contemplated individual medication dispensers located at bedside in association with individual patients. However, the use of multiple bedside dispensers can be relatively costly and further requires regular manual attention to ensure proper loading and individualized programming for each patient. Other systems have envisioned centralized units at a nursing station or the like for maintaining different medications and related pharmaceutical items under locked storage. While such centralized units have provided improved safety and enhanced record keeping for narcotic substances, such units have unduly restricted access to many routine pharmaceutical items. Accordingly, prior centralized medication units have not met with commercial acceptance on any significant scale.\nAs stated above, there is presently available a wide variety of medication dispenser stations (Pyxis Remote Manager(trademark), Medstation(copyright), MedSelect(copyright) External Lock Modules and the like) for use at centralized location in a medical facility. However, one problem with these point-of-use systems is that because the entire system is hard wire (cable) connected, the dispenser station must be located relatively close, if not adjacent, to the refrigerator or drawer to which access is controlled. This limitation proves costly in a hospital environment where space is at a premium. Additionally, there exists the problem of requiring a dispenser station juxtaposed to each and every refrigerator or drawer to which controlled access is desired. Because the manufacturers of these dispenser stations generate income by either selling or leasing such stations, the user is burdened with increased costs.\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,151,536, which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein, discloses a method of eliminating the hard wire connection between a dispenser station and a lock of an auxiliary location by using a wireless transmitter or an infra-red coupler. One problem with this method, though, is that it requires the direct coupling of the lock at the auxiliary location to a processor located at the dispensing station. Another problem is that the \"\"536 method requires the user to active manually an item sensor at the dispensing station to record accurately the removal of an inventoried item from the auxiliary location.\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,112,502, which is also incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein, discloses a dispensing method for medical items whereby an existing auxiliary storage location, such as a refrigerator, is retrofitted with a lock module that controls access to the location\"\"s contents. The lock module is unlocked via a signal sent from a display terminal or other computer that is directly coupled to the dispensing system. That is, like the \"\"536 method, the \"\"502 method requires a direct coupling between the auxiliary storage location and the central dispensing system. Additionally, the following United States Patents disclose central dispensing systems directly coupled to an auxiliary storage location and are incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,068,156; 6,039,467; 5,971,593; 5,912,818; 5,883,806, and 5,790,409. Each of the foregoing patents disclose a central dispensing system that selectively limits access to a directly coupled auxiliary storage location. Because of the direct coupling mechanism, existing dispensing systems cannot control access to locations to which they are not coupled. Naturally, coupling the location to the system results in an unwanted expense.\nThere exists, therefore, a significant need for an improved security system for controlling access to pharmaceutical, medical, surgical, therapeutic items and the like, wherein there is no need for the dispenser station to be directly coupled to a lock at an auxiliary location, thus allowing existing dispensing systems to remain in place.\nThe present invention is provided to solve these and other problems.\nThe present invention provides a method for selectively dispensing inventoried items. The first step of the method is providing a storage means adapted with a lock. The second step is providing a wireless unlocking means removably secured in the storage means. The wireless unlocking means is able to transmit an unlocking signal upon activation by a user.\nThe next step of the method is where the user is unlocking the lock in order to access the storage means and the wireless unlocking means. The wireless locking means is wirelessly coupled to a locking system located at a secondary storage location. That is, the lock at the secondary storage location can be lock and unlocked any number of times upon receipt of the unlocking signal. The secondary storage location houses at least one inventoried item. The method further provides for activating the wireless unlocking means to transmit the unlocking signal to the locking system, thereby unlocking the locking system and permitting the user to access the secondary storage location. The method finally provides for removing an inventoried item from the secondary storage location. If desired, the locking system at the secondary location or the lock at the storage means can be relocked and the method repeated.\nFurther aspects of the invention are disclosed in the detailed description of the preferred embodiment, the drawings and the claims.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Degree of sex reversal as related to plasma steroid levels in genetic female chickens (Gallus domesticus) treated with Fadrozole.\nThe objectives of this work were to determine whether or not plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol reflect the various grades of sex reversal in genetic female chickens treated with Fadrozole (CGS 16949 A), a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, and whether gonadal aromatase activity and plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol in treated females can or not be modified by post-hatch treatments with Fadrozole or Fadrozole + testosterone. Eggs were injected with 1 mg Fadrozole on day 4 of incubation. In females having developed sex-reversed gonads, endocrine parameters (estradiol and testosterone) at and after 13 weeks of age were indicative of the degree of sex reversal, with, for example, sex-reversed females with two testes having the highest levels of testosterone and the lowest levels of estradiol. Among these females, eight (from a total of 13) produced ejaculates with scarce and abnormal spermatozoa. Some motility was observable in the ejaculates from five of them. None of the post-hatch treatments had a significant effect on plasma levels of testosterone or estradiol (measured at 3-week intervals from week 4 to week 28 post-hatch) or on gonadal aromatase activity (measured at 12 and 28 weeks). In conclusion, these results indicate that plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol at and after 13 weeks of age are valuable indicators of the degree of sex reversal in female chickens treated with Fadrozole prior to gonadal sex differentiation. In pre-cited conditions, post-natal treatments with either Fadrozole or Fadrozole + testosterone had no apparent effect on the degree of sex reversal in these birds. Finally, the occurrence of ejaculates with motile although scarce and abnormal spermatozoa, revealed that epididymes and ducti deferens can develop and become functional in sex-reversed female chickens.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The purpose of this application is to determine whether a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MTNX), attenuates certain subjective effects of a mu opioid analgesic, morphine, and to determine if MTNX changes the abuse liability-related profile of morphine to be more positive in healthy volunteers. It is currently used in patients on chronic opioid therapy for the relief of opioid-induced constipation, a peripherally-mediated side effect. Because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it does not antagonize the analgesic effect of opioids that is centrally mediated. Results from two small-N studies conducted in healthy volunteers indicate that aversive subjective effects that are induced by opioids, such as nausea, might be attenuated by pretreatment with MTNX. The study results were not definitive for several reasons, and we feel a more systematic laboratory analysis would clearly be of value. We intend to use MTNX as a probe to determine whether, and to what extent, certain subjective effects of opioids are mediated by peripheral opiate receptors. Healthy volunteers with no history of opioid abuse or dependence will participate in a placebo- controlled, double-blind, randomized, crossover trial in which they will be exposed to placebo, morphine alone (0.14 mg/kg, iv), two doses of MTNX (0.225, 0.45 mg/kg, sc) combined with morphine, and the higher dose of MTNX tested alone. The primary dependent measure in this study is subjective effects. Secondary measures include physiological and psychomotor effects. The study is significant from a basic psychopharmacology and pharmacology standpoint in that it will address the extent to which prototypic subjective effects of mu opioids are mediated at peripheral opiate receptors. It is significant from a clinical standpoint in that will address whether MTNX might have potential therapeutic implications beyond its ability to relieve constipation. It is significant and innovative from an abuse liability standpoint. Abuse liability of a drug is putatively influenced not only by positive effects of a drug but also negative effects, so if negative effects of morphine are attenuated by MTNX, the abuse liability-related profile of morphine may shift to where morphine is predominantly liked by the majority of healthy volunteers, a finding which would run counter to a number of studies in the extant literature with healthy volunteers.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Music creation enthusiasts are hoping that a faster, sleeker version of Linux Multimedia Studio (LMMS) will be made available in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nReasoning that, with five years of support on the cards, Ubuntu’s LTS users should have access to the upcoming version 1.0 release, a bug report requesting a Feature Freeze exception has been opened against LMMS on Launchpad.\n\nLMMS – The Linux ‘Fruity Loops’\n\nLMMS is modelled after the popular, proprietary Windows-only Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) FL Studio (formerly known as FruityLoops, and whose notable users include Avicii and BassHunter).\n\nA free, open-source alternative, LMMS features a similar modular workspace to FL Studio, provides a variety of built-in virtual software instruments and loops, and supports select third-party VST plugins. It aims to give users with all the tools they need for straightforward ‘…creation of melodies and beats, the synthesis and mixing of sounds, and arranging of samples’.\n\nIn requesting the feature freeze LMMS user Israel Dahl argues:\n\n“I think it is necessary to get this version of LMMS into the repos, as it has many bug fixes, and HUGE overall improvements, and performance improvements. Since Trusty is an LTS, I think the newest available version should get in.”\n\nThe list of changes, fixes and improvements in the proposed builds, version 1.0.0, over the ‘current’ build available to Ubuntu 14.04 users, version 4.9.x, is exhaustive, spanning everything from a refined interface with better system icon handling to superior performance and memory leak fixes.\n\nFeature Freeze fell into effect on February 20, which is a long time ago amid the rigid development milestones of a typical Ubuntu release cycle. With this release being an LTS there is an argument to be made to including the best software, but it cannot be at the expense of stability.\n\nWould you like to find LMMS 1.0 in the Ubuntu Software Centre this April?", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Australian family held hostage by drug-crazed gunman on Thai holiday\n\nThis is the terrifying moment an Australian family cowered in fear after a drug-crazed gunman held them hostage as they ate in a restaurant.\n\nThe three tourists, who have not been named yet, were dining out at a beach bar in Krabi, Thailand, when Ekkapoj Puangphet, 32, stormed in brandishing the handgun yesterday (Tue) evening at 7 pm.\n\nEkkapoj - who was high on alcohol and yaba - ordered the Aussies and three massage workers also eating in the venue to lie face down on the ground as he locked the door.\n\nThe shirtless bandit - covered in tattoos and with a red bandana over his face - then let off four rounds on the second floor of the wooden building prompting cries of terror and panic among the hostages and those outside.\n\nPolice eventually contacted the gunman's father and passed the mobile phone Ekkapoj him. He was eventually arrested an hour later with 50 armed police on standby outside.\n\nHe had a pistol and nine bullets on him.\n\nThe gunman told cops he had arrived the previous day from his home in Nakhon Si Thammarat province before going on a drink and drugs binge.\n\nHe said he found the restaurant on the popular Railey Beach part of the tourist resort and became paranoid he was about to be harmed.\n\nPoice Lieutenant Colonel Phitsanu Puangprom, commander of the investigation division of the Krabi Police head office, said: ''There were six hostages.

Ty S. Mitchell and Kimberly S. Mitchell appeal.\n\n        The Mitchells assert that Beneficial violated the Home Ownership and Equity\nProtection Act (HOEPA). HOEPA, as relevant here, requires creditors to make\nadditional disclosures to borrowers if the total points and fees payable at closing\nexceed 8 percent of the total loan amount, or $400, whichever is greater. 15 U.S.C.\n§§ 1602(aa)(1)(B), 1639(a). The Mitchells argue that the $355 appraisal fee, $821\ntitle insurance fee, $67 phone-bill charge, or $1,178 principal disbursement should be\nincluded in the total points and fees of their loan. If any one of these were included,\nthe total points and fees would exceed 8 percent of the total loan amount, making the\nloan subject to HOEPA.\n\n      Appraisal and title insurance fees, if bona fide and reasonable, are excluded\nfrom HOEPA's definition of total points and fees. 15 U.S.C. § 1605(e) ; 12 C.F.R. §\n226.4(c)(7). On appeal, the Mitchells claim that these fees are not bona fide and not\nreasonable because they violate the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA),\n12 U.S.C. § 2607(b). The district court correctly found that these fees did not violate\nRESPA because they were paid to an unaffiliated third party for services actually\nperformed, and, in any event, Beneficial derived no benefit from the payments. See\nHaug v. Bank of America, 317 F.3d 832, 836 (8th Cir. 2003). As for the telephone\ncharge and principal disbursement, the statute does not include them in total points\nand fees. 15 U.S.C. § 1602(aa)(4). The Mitchells' loan did not need HOEPA\ndisclosures.\n\n     After de novo review, see Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1016\n  th\n(8 Cir. 1999), this court affirms the district court's judgment.\n\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n       1\n       The Honorable James M. Rosenbaum, Chief Judge, United States District\nCourt for the District of Minnesota.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Fashion\n\nFashion Designer Uma Wang Debuts FW 2012 Collection\n\nChinese fashion designer Uma Wang is rapidly emerging as the industry's first truly international designer. In her FW '12 collection, she showcases the signature east meets west that has helped her become one to watch. Wang's Milan showing featured Western cowboy dusters combined with traditional knitwear for an Avant- Garde, Gothic aesthetic. Using mostly black with hints of dark greens and the occasional khaki, the color palette was deceptively simple as Wang kept it interesting by combining fabrics rather than prints.\n\nNothing in Wang’s line was form fitting, rather the cuts that came down the runway were roomy dresses sometimes worn over pants, but nothing was baggy or shapeless, just elegantly drapey. As is typical of Wang, many of the designs were asymmetric and for this show, had a definite 90’s grunge look showcased in the holey sweaters and nubby fabrics. Although Wang spent time in China perfecting her knitwear, she also trained at London's elite Central Saint Martins before launching her line in 2005. Wang has come to the attention of fashion's elite including Hung Huang, Angelica Cheung, Franca Sozzani, and Anna Wintour.\n\nThese designers appreciate her hard work, transcendent design philosophy, and embodiment of her eponymous brand. In 2011, Wang won the Audi Progessive Designer Award, the same award that American designer Phillip Lim had won the previous year. Other accolades for Wang include the Finest Craft and Best Creativity awards at Shanghai Fashion Week during 2009 and 2010, as well as the Beijing CCDC Best Designer award in 2010.

{"text": "1. Introduction {#sec1-ijms-20-04405}\n===============\n\nThere are approximately 5000--8000 rare diseases or conditions that affect 6--8% of the population \\[Regulation EC No. 141/2000, 2000\\]. Patients with these conditions are often isolated and experience significant obstacles in accessing high quality healthcare and information. Research activity for these conditions is often poorly coordinated, insufficiently powered, and lacks quality and effectiveness. The group of conditions that are usually included within the broad umbrella of Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) is a typical example where there is a substantial lack of knowledge about aetiology and long term outcome, and initiatives in research are limited by the low prevalence of individual conditions. Whilst centres of expertise can bring together multidisciplinary competencies around the needs of patients, the creation of virtual networks is becoming a necessity to coordinate the work of these nodes, speed up the pace of discovery by pooling scarce resources, and ensure patient empowerment by creating a common strong voice on behalf of these patients. Data collection and archiving from a wide range of sources can bridge this knowledge gap. Often this can take the form of rare disease registries; however, registries can exist in a number of different forms. They can exist as detailed disease registries; a registry that only collects core data; a registry that simply performs e-surveillance; or a registry that links data from existing sources. This review will aim to cover how registries are helping in supporting research and clinical practice in DSD with a specific focus on the International Disorders of Sex Development (I-DSD) and International Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (I-CAH) Registries.\n\n2. The Development of the I-DSD Registry {#sec2-ijms-20-04405}\n========================================\n\nThe Consensus Workshop on DSD which was jointly hosted by the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society of North America in 2005 highlighted the need for the creation and maintenance of a database in centres of expertise \\[[@B1-ijms-20-04405]\\]. At the time, such databases did exist in many regional and national centres and had provided valuable insight into many aspects of DSD, including epidemiology \\[[@B2-ijms-20-04405],[@B3-ijms-20-04405],[@B4-ijms-20-04405]\\], variation of disease expression \\[[@B5-ijms-20-04405]\\], initial adjustment of parents to their affected child's condition \\[[@B6-ijms-20-04405]\\], variation of investigations, and long-term outcome \\[[@B7-ijms-20-04405]\\]. However, these databases and registers lacked international uniformity, a key feature particularly desirable when dealing with a rare group of conditions. With the initial help of ESPE followed by the European Union, through an EUFP7 funded project, EuroDSD a European web-based registry and research environment for DSD was developed between 2008 and 2011. During this period, the registry gained international popularity beyond Europe, and from 2011 to 2017 it received funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to become the I-DSD Registry. The day to day management of the I-DSD and I-CAH registries is undertaken by the Project Management Group which is guided by the joint Steering Committee which is responsible for the overall direction of the initiative. New research proposals are handled by the Project Management Group and reviewed by a Scientific Panel. Members of the Steering Committee and the Scientific Panel have fixed terms. Increasingly, the Steering Committee consists of representatives of international societies that have a dedicated DSD working group. Other members of the Steering Committee and Scientific Panel are chosen from those who are actively involved in I-DSD or I-CAH.\n\n3. Description of the Cases in the I-DSD Registry {#sec3-ijms-20-04405}\n=================================================\n\nAs of June 2019, there were 2456 cases with DSD registered on the I-DSD Registry. These cases are from 80 centres in 34 countries across 5 continents. Overall, 1391 (57%) are male and the highest number of cases are registered as having a disorder of gonadal development (*n* = 758, 31%) followed by disorders of androgen action (*n* = 589, 24%). Of those reported as males, the most common registered conditions are disorders of gonadal development (*n* = 384, 28%) followed by non-specific XY DSD (*n* = 337, 24%) and disorders of androgen action (*n* = 236, 17%). Of those reported as females, the most common registered conditions are disorders of androgen action (*n* = 374, 35%) followed by disorders of gonadal development (*n* = 353, 33%) and disorders of androgen synthesis (*n* = 187, 18%). The majority of the registered cases are 46, XY (*n* = 1741, 71%). Currently, the age distribution of registered cases ranges from \\<1 year to 77 years (median 22 years), with the highest proportion currently being over the age of 16 years (*n* = 787, 32%). Overall, comparison of the case mix that exists in the I-DSD Registry \\[[@B8-ijms-20-04405]\\] to the range of cases that may exist in a specialist service \\[[@B9-ijms-20-04405]\\] has shown significant similarities.\n\n4. Past and Current Research Activities of the I-DSD Registry {#sec4-ijms-20-04405}\n=============================================================\n\nTo date collaborations through the I-DSD Registry have generated almost 20 published articles, which have cumulatively been cited over 200 times. Each collaboration has offered new insights into the field of DSD, changing the way that clinicians approach patients affected by these conditions. One of the first published outputs from the I-DSD Registry was by Koleskinska et al. in 2014 \\[[@B10-ijms-20-04405]\\]. This research not only demonstrated that the I-DSD Registry could be effectively used to pool data on DSD but it was also seminal in highlighting that the practice of assigning female sex to 46, XY infants had reduced over time and that this was irrespective of the degree of masculinisation of the external genitalia \\[[@B10-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Later, Cox et al. (Cox et al. 2014) identified that as many as 27% of individuals affected by DSD may have an associated condition and that the frequency of additional associated conditions was highest in disorders of gonadal development and in nonspecific 46, XY DSD \\[[@B8-ijms-20-04405]\\]. One of the commonest associated conditions was small for gestational age (SGA), which was confirmed by Poyrazoglu who subsequently reported that as many as 18% of 46, XY individuals may be born SGA \\[[@B11-ijms-20-04405]\\]. These investigators also highlighted that the presence of SGA in those with XY DSD provided helpful insights into the underlying aetiology. Each of these studies highlights the increasing clinical knowledge that can be obtained via research activities using the I-DSD Registry. The importance of identifying the underlying aetiology was further reinforced in the study by Lucas-Herald et al. which showed that a molecular confirmation of a defect in the androgen receptor was critical in predicting the long-term outcome in clinically diagnosed cases of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome \\[[@B12-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Collecting long-term outcome data in PAIS has been difficult to date and the utility of the I-DSD Registry was clearly proven in this context. Another challenging area that the I-DSD Registry has tackled is the long-term outcome of the gonads in cases of androgen insensitivity \\[[@B13-ijms-20-04405]\\] as well as those cases with 45X/XY gonadal dysgenesis \\[[@B14-ijms-20-04405]\\]. All of these research projects answer questions on DSD, which would not be possible in these rare diseases with only small local datasets. In addition, their outputs can be used to inform clinical care and health service provision for affected individuals. However, research activities from the I-DSD Registry are not just confined to studies of long-term outcome. In 2016, Hornig et al. were able to perform genetic analysis of cultured genital fibroblasts from 169 male individuals with DSD, through identification of cases in the Registry and collaboration with the local centres, where consent for analysis was given \\[[@B15-ijms-20-04405]\\]. As a result, they reported a new class of individuals who were Androgen Receptor (AR) mutation negative but had a PAIS phenotype, who could be reliably identified using transcriptional induction of an AR target protein, apolipoprotein D (APOD) \\[[@B15-ijms-20-04405]\\]. The Registry has also been used to identify specialists in the field of DSD through international surveys regarding current models of practice in DSD, in terms of medical and surgical management \\[[@B16-ijms-20-04405]\\] as well as psychosocial care \\[[@B17-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Given much of the work produced from the I-DSD Registry relies on the correct input of data by Registry users, confirmation of the quality of the data is of course essential \\[[@B18-ijms-20-04405]\\]. As such, the quality of the data in the Registry has recently been reviewed, demonstrating that it has a high degree of accuracy \\[[@B19-ijms-20-04405]\\] and thereby confirming the validity of the information included in associated studies. There are currently 9 ongoing studies that are using the I-DSD Registry, with the number of studies starting per year increasing annually (from 1 to 5 per year on average). Further details of these studies are available on the I-DSD website (<https://home.i-dsd.org>).\n\n5. The Development of the I-CAH Registry {#sec5-ijms-20-04405}\n========================================\n\nBy 2013, it was clear that the I-DSD Registry was also being used by several centres to recruit cases of CAH. However, to collect information on CAH, the fields within the I-DSD Registry were not completely suitable and, in addition, given that some cases of CAH could not be classed as DSD, an international network of researchers and clinicians looking after people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) was created to facilitate the development of a CAH module within the I-DSD Registry. In addition, the I-CAH Registry could be entered through a separate website, entitled the *I-CAH Registry*. This approach allowed the registry project to match the pace of discovery of new management strategies and therapies for patients with CAH. This development continued to be managed and administered by the I-DSD governing body and was supported by the TAIN (Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency in Neonates) project which was an EU-funded consortium dedicated to developing a new formulation of hydrocortisone. The I-CAH Registry has developed a major focus on pharmacovigilance and has also been exploring how it can be used to develop clinical benchmarks. The longitudinal module in the I-CAH registry has also often been used as a clinical tool in a clinic setting, highlighting the power of disease registries in guiding clinical users towards standardised data collection within the routine clinical setting whilst acting as an indispensable tool within the clinical setting.\n\n6. Description of the Cases in the I-CAH Registry {#sec6-ijms-20-04405}\n=================================================\n\nAs of June 2019, there were 1429 cases of CAH registered in the I-CAH Registry. These cases are from 65 centres in 29 countries across 5 continents. Overall, 815 patients (57%) are female. A karyotype of 46, XX was registered in 756 (53%) of cases. The majority of registered cases are attributed to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (*CYP21A2*) (*n* = 1312, 92%), followed by 11β- hydroxylase deficiency (*CYP11B1*) (*n* = 55, 4%). Other rare types of CAH account for less than 1% of all registered cases and include 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (*HSD3B2*) (*n* = 18, 1%), 17α-hydroxylase deficiency (*CYP17A1*) (*n* = 9, 0.6%), cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (*POR*) (*n* = 4, 0.3%), and steroid acute regulatory protein deficiency (*StAR*) (*n* = 2, 0.1%). The majority of cases within the I-CAH registry presented aged less than 3 months (*n* = 913, 64%). Currently, the age distribution of cases ranges from birth to 82 years (median 15 years), with almost half of all cases aged 16 years or over (*n* = 685, 48%).\n\n7. Past and Current Research Activities of the I-CAH Registry {#sec7-ijms-20-04405}\n=============================================================\n\nThe development of the I-CAH Registry in 2014 has enabled pooling of data for research and multi-centre collaborations in the field of CAH, providing further insight into the diagnosis, management, and outcomes in this rare condition. An initial study evaluating the variation in practice for reaching a diagnosis of CAH demonstrated user acceptability of the I-CAH Registry, with a 10-fold increase in the number of cases registered and a temporal shift in diagnostic practice towards the use of molecular genetics \\[[@B20-ijms-20-04405]\\]. The quality of the data within the I-CAH registry has also been examined and has demonstrated a high degree of validity, consistency and accuracy for conditions such as CAH, with the highest degree of internal validity for CAH compared with other registered conditions affecting sex development \\[[@B19-ijms-20-04405]\\].\n\nThe longitudinal module was developed in 2015 and studies incorporating data from this module have provided a greater understanding of current medical management in patients with CAH, providing an opportunity to compare treatment regimens and outcomes amongst different centres. Physiological replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid is vital for optimal control in patients with CAH. A lack of evidence based guidelines for salt and mineralocorticoid replacement in young children with CAH was reflected in a recent I-CAH study which demonstrated substantial variation in salt supplementation regimens, including timing of treatment, frequency and dosing, in children under the age of three years, with variations dependant on the treatment centre \\[[@B21-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Similarly, data from a cohort of 269 patients from 22 centres in 14 countries confirmed variation in hormonal replacement regimens across paediatric and adult patients with glucocorticoid doses above the recommended thresholds in some age groups \\[[@B22-ijms-20-04405]\\]. The management of CAH requires a balance between excess glucocorticoid leading to adverse effects and a deficiency of glucocorticoid leading to a risk of adrenal crises. The I-CAH longitudinal module can also be used to collect prospective data on the occurrence on adverse events in CAH, including sick day episodes and adrenal crises. A preliminary analysis of this data has demonstrated that patients with CAH experience frequent sick day episodes \\[[@B23-ijms-20-04405]\\] and further studies are ongoing to determine factors which may be associated with the occurrence of adrenal insufficiency related adverse events. There are currently seven ongoing studies that are using the I-CAH Registry including industry supported-studies that are examining the feasibility of studies using novel therapeutic options in CAH. Further information on future studies and developments can be obtained from the I-CAH website (<http://home.i-cah.org>).\n\n8. The Respective Role of Detailed Disease Registries, Core Registries and Surveillance Systems for Studying DSD {#sec8-ijms-20-04405}\n================================================================================================================\n\nDSD are a group of relatively rare conditions with a wide spectrum of pathophysiology. These conditions pose a challenge due to gaps in knowledge of long-term outcomes and a lack of evidence based multidisciplinary care. Rare disease registries enable pooling of data for research, healthcare surveillance, multicentre collaboration, and the development of best practice guidelines. Participation in international registries for rare conditions such as DSD is encouraged \\[[@B24-ijms-20-04405],[@B25-ijms-20-04405]\\] and has been endorsed by many European and international initiatives such as EURODIS (European Organisation for Rare Diseases), EUCERD (European Union Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases) and IRDiRC (International Rare Diseases Research Consortium). A recent survey amongst reference centre leads of the European Reference Network for Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN) sought to evaluate the level of engagement in local, national, and international disease registries for rare endocrine conditions \\[[@B26-ijms-20-04405]\\]. This exercise highlighted that despite a high level of awareness of registries for conditions such as DSD within these expert centres, participation in registries was relatively low. There may be several factors contributing to the low participation rates including lack of patient consent, lack of sufficient time to recruit patients or enter data \\[[@B16-ijms-20-04405]\\] or the absence of transparent quality indicators for the registries \\[[@B27-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Optimising participation in registries while encouraging record completion and data entry at regular intervals may be achieved by improving the registry user interface, reducing the number of fields required for completion, or perhaps focusing on completion of core information. Furthermore, consideration should be given to methods of sustaining registries over the longer-term including membership fees, dissemination of information through newsletters and increased stakeholder/ patient involvement. The biennial international I-DSD meeting has also been very helpful in providing the I-DSD and I-CAH users with a community spirit and a common vision.\n\nBased on the lessons learnt in I-DSD, and with support from Endo-ERN, the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and European Society of Endocrinology, the endocrine community in Europe has embarked on a new project funded by the European Union's Health Programme, EuRRECa (European Registries for Rare Endocrine Conditions, eurreca.net). The aim of this project is to maximise the opportunity for patients, health care professionals, and researchers to participate in high-quality, patient-centred registries for DSD and other rare endocrine conditions covered within Endo-ERN. The two main arms of the projects are: 1. A core endocrine registry that collects a core dataset based on standardised data entry with signposting to high quality, detailed, disease-specific registries, 2. An e-reporting programme for rare endocrine conditions (e-REC) which enables measurement of core indicators of ERN activity. Thus, in addition to rare disease registries such as the I-DSD and I-CAH Registry, there may be a place for a core registry that only collects core patient information (e.g., EuRRECa Core Endocrine Registry) and which directs people to detailed disease registries and which is supported by an even more light-touch surveillance system that enables e-reporting of conditions. This pathway of linking registries within a defined network will allow the possibility of long-term sustainability and improve the quality and validity of registries with the overall aim of optimising patient care and research. Furthermore, linking existing registries would provide current platforms with options to select which data are shared. Registries would only be able to be linked if they had common data elements, thus the linking of data would also lead to greater standardisation of data and its quality. Linking of registries would also lead to greater clarity and transparency of data access as it is likely that only registries with stringent governance protocols will be in a position to share data.\n\n9. Examples of How Studying Rare Conditions Such as DSD & CAH Can be Performed at A Local, National, and International Level Through a Wide Range of Platforms {#sec9-ijms-20-04405}\n==============================================================================================================================================================\n\nKnowledge of conditions such as DSD and CAH can be gleaned through a wide range of databases. Studies performed in the early 2000s using linked data sets within the National Health Service in Scotland allowed the development of a congenital anomaly register that was designed specifically to collect information on genital anomalies. These studies provided helpful epidemiological data and supported the development of a national clinical network in Scotland \\[[@B2-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Whilst epidemiological studies have a clearly important role, their role is limited when it comes to understanding variations in management and outcome for a heterogeneous group of rare conditions within a relatively small population. In Scotland, the formation of a clinical network led to the development of a local disease registry which was used to understand clinical practice nationwide \\[[@B6-ijms-20-04405],[@B28-ijms-20-04405]\\] and this registry was superseded by the I-DSD Registry. At a regional level, the Scottish DSD network has focussed more over the last 5 years on performing an electronic surveillance exercise within Scotland monitoring the presentation of newborns with atypical genitalia \\[[@B29-ijms-20-04405]\\]. This exercise has allowed it to combine an epidemiological objective with an objective related to service improvement. The relatively small population of Scotland combined with the existence of defined clinical networks has facilitated this surveillance exercise.\n\nOn the other hand, detailed meaningful studies of a condition such as Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) which has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 15,000 births \\[[@B30-ijms-20-04405]\\] would not be possible in Scotland, which has an annual birth rate of about 55,000. The majority of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with more than 90% of cases occurring secondary to 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency \\[[@B31-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Clinical features of classical CAH include androgen excess with resultant genital ambiguity in females, precocious puberty, infertility and reduced quality of life in affected individuals \\[[@B32-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Furthermore, in CAH, the resultant adrenocortical enzyme deficiency provides patients with a life-long risk of adverse events including sick day episodes and ensuing adrenal crises \\[[@B33-ijms-20-04405]\\], the leading cause of mortality in CAH \\[[@B32-ijms-20-04405]\\]. There is little evidence on the occurrence of adverse events (sick day episodes and adrenal crises) in children with CAH from large multi-centre cohort studies. Data on the frequency of adverse events in adrenal insufficiency have been collected in different settings such as local centres \\[[@B33-ijms-20-04405]\\] as well as at a national level \\[[@B34-ijms-20-04405]\\]. The I-DSD and I-CAH Registries provide an ideal platform for the study of core clinical outcomes at a global level, with the overall aim of better informing the clinical and patient community and laying a foundation for which future studies can target interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of children with CAH.\n\n10. Example of How Disease Registries Can Develop a Network that Provides Other Benefits {#sec10-ijms-20-04405}\n========================================================================================\n\nDisease registries, in particular those integrated at international level, are pivotal in the development of networks as centres of expertise. This is particularly important in the field of rare conditions as these resources facilitate the pooling of specialists around the world as well as concentrating data in patients with rare conditions. I-DSD is an example of such a registry which has developed a network of experts that collaborate across borders to discuss expert management of similar cases. Registered users and the wider community have regular (biennial) symposia that are held around the world, with the 2019 meeting being held outside Europe for the first time (Sau Paulo, July 2019). The I-DSD Registry also facilitated the development of a network of DSD centres and specialists that formed the backbone of initiatives such as the I-DSD network, COST DSDnet and the reference centres within the European Reference Network for Rare Endocrine Conditions (Endo-ERN) and supported a fixed term project, DSDlife, that studied the general quality of life and psychological well-being as well as the quality and satisfaction with past treatments in adult patients with DSD ([www.dsd-life.eu](www.dsd-life.eu)). I-DSD and COST DSDnet also combined forces to organize a patient workshop which explored several issues including the need for research and the use of registries \\[[@B35-ijms-20-04405]\\]. In addition to DSDlife and DSDnet, the I-DSD Registry also complemented other EU projects such as EU-TAIN (Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency in Neonates) which led to the development of I-CAH, an international registry for CAH.\n\n11. Future Direction-Quality, FAIR Values, Inclusion and Sustainability {#sec11-ijms-20-04405}\n=======================================================================\n\nWhilst over a decade ago, there was relatively little interest in detailed disease registries for rare conditions, there are now over 800 rare disease registries in Europe alone. The emphasis on registries has been further strengthened with the inclusion of participation in rare disease registries as a quality indicator of a reference centre. The utility and long-term sustainability of a detailed disease registry can increase significantly if the data that are stored within the registry adhere to the principles of FAIR data (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). This involves designing it to comply with international standards of quality, structure and content, access control, and also adopting common methods and processes for information/patient discoverability, sharing and federation with other registries. Thereby, users can more easily compare, pool, and analyse patient datasets, using sufficient numbers of cases for meaningful clinical research and public health purposes in areas identified as high priority by the DSD community \\[[@B36-ijms-20-04405]\\]. Going forward, it will become particularly important for the I-DSD and I-CAH registries to maximise their quality \\[[@B18-ijms-20-04405]\\] and increase the participation of patients and professionals in activities that are aimed at improving clinical care as well as our knowledge of these conditions A high quality disease registry also requires clear governance structures and scrutiny and the effort involved in providing this is often under-estimated. The joint management of the I-CAH and I-DSD registries as well as the sharing of a common platform has maximised efficiency and effectiveness whilst ensuring that patients, clinicians and researchers continue to remain fully involved in their respective areas of interest. This strategy can be applied to other conditions that may affect sexual development and are not traditionally considered as DSD.\n\n12. Summary {#sec12-ijms-20-04405}\n===========\n\nIn summary, the I-DSD and I-CAH registries are powerful tools for improving our knowledge of a group of rare conditions where research, particularly in the field of outcome, has been hampered by the inherent rarity and heterogeneity of the conditions. The registries have also led to the development of a strong clinical and research network and it is anticipated that the wider user community will continue to use the registries to develop new studies within all related disciplines.\n\nSRA is supported by an unrestricted education grant from Diurnal and the Gardiner Lectureship at the University of Glasgow.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "[Development of acute and chronic respiratory diseases during pregnancy].\nPhysiological respiratory and hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy result in increased oxygen consumption related to fetal growth. The increase in the maternal basal metabolism leads to hyperventilation and increased cardiac output. This explains why pathological respiratory or cardiovascular conditions existing prior to pregnancy can rapidly worsen during the course of the pregnancy. However, even if no cardiorespiratory disease exists prior to pregnancy, an inhalation lung disease, pre-eclampsia or sepsis can lead to pulmonary edema due to the increased plasma volume in the pregnant woman. These different pathological situations as well as infectious lung diseases are discussed here. We examine the evolution of respiratory function during the course of labor, delivery and the post-partum period. In addition, pregnancy also has an effect on chronic respiratory disease, particularly asthma.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nGet last value from incomplete observable\n\nThere is an incomplete observable which can have or not have a replay of n values. I would like to get the last value from it - or just the next one if there is none yet.\nThis works for first available value with first() and take(1) (example):\npossiblyReplayedIncomplteObservable.first().toPromise().then(val => ...);\n\nBut for the last value both last() and takeLast(1) wait for observable completion - not the desirable behaviour here.\nHow can this be solved? Is there a specific operator for that?\n\nA:\n\nI had a solution for ReplaySubject(2) that 'drains' the sequence to get the latest element and if the sequence is empty simply takes the last element, yet, it was cumbersome and did not scale well (for example, if you decide to increase the replay size to 3). I then remembered that Replay/Behavior subjects tend to be hard to manage when they are piped. The simplest solution to that is to create a 'shadow' sequence and pipe your ReplaySubject into it (instead of creating it by transformation/operation on your ReplaySubject), hence:\nvar subject$ = new Rx.ReplaySubject(3);\nvar lastValue$ = new Rx.ReplaySubject(1);\nsubject$.subscribe(lastValue$); // short hand for subject$.subscribe(v => lastValue$.next(v))\n\nlastValue$.take(1).toPromise().then(...);\n\n========== Old solutions, ignoring the ReplaySubject(2) =================\nAfter reading the comment below, the correct code is:\nRx.Observable.combineLatest(possiblyReplayedIncomplteObservable).take(1).subscribe(...)\n\nand not\nRx.Observable.combineLatest(possiblyReplayedIncomplteObservable).subscribe(...)\n\nThis is due to the fact the promise is a \"one time\" observable. I think the toPromise() code resolves the result only on completion.\nThe take(1) will not affect your original stream since it operates on the new stream which is created by combineLatest.\nAnd actually, the simplest way is:\npossiblyReplayedIncomplteObservable.take(1).toPromise().then(...)\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

I now have an Android phone (HTC Desire, Android 2.2) and I made a first test.\nOpening and closing a database is relatively slow so far (opening an existing database for the second time takes 0.2 seconds, closing about 0.2 seconds), but otherwise it looks like H2 performs quite well on Android, even if the Dalvik VM is not yet as optimized as a desktop JVM. It's too early to give concrete numbers, but Android is now a supported platform.\n\nA:\n\nI would be also very interested in real-world performance tests for the H2 database on Android. I think that H2 will be a lot slower than SQLite, mainly because the virtual machine on Android is still not that great. This got better with Android 2.2, but I think there is still a big difference.

{"text": "The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms of how genes are regulated in different tissues. This will be accomplished through the study of the human gene encoding debranching enzyme and molecular analysis of Type III glycogen storage disease. In this disease there are patients who lack debranching enzyme activity in both liver and muscle, and patients with enzyme deficiency confined to liver; yet the enzyme is a monomeric protein and appears to be identical in all tissues. The proposed research hypothesizes that debranching enzyme in liver and muscle is encoded by a single gene; its expression, however, is under separate genetic control. Patients with various clinical and enzymatic subgroups of Type III glycogen storage disease are being followed at Duke Medical Center; fibroblasts from these patients have been collected and stored. The debranching enzyme has been purified from porcine muscle and the antibody characterized. The cDNA coding for debranching enzyme from both human liver and muscle will be isolated by screening lambda gtll human cDNA libraries with antibody against porcine debranching enzyme. The debranching enzyme mRNA in these two tissues will be compared by Northern blot analysis, cDNA sequencing and/or sequencing of mRNA by primer extension. The chromosomal gene(s) coding for debrancher enzyme will be isolated, and the molecular structure and number of copies of the genes will be determined. Information about the number of debrancher genes and the sequences of the mRNA from liver and muscle will be used to design strategies to investigate the mechanism responsible for control of tissue-specific debrancher gene expression. This may involve sequencing of the 5' flanking region for two possible transcription initiation sites, or in the case of two different mRNA sequences encoded by a single gene, sequencing the regions of the gene that specify the mRNA unique to liver or muscle. The defective chromosomal debrancher genes from patients with disease confined to liver will also be cloned and the mutations characterized. Molecular classification of Type III glycogen storage disease will be performed at the protein, mRNA, and gene levels. These molecular findings will be correlated to the type and severity of clinical phenotypic expression. Information gained on molecular structure of glycogen debrancher gene and human mutants lacking debrancher activity may lead to identifying DNA regions important in the control of tissue-specific gene expression, and may provide a model for mechanisms responsible for clinical variability in other genetic disorders.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Revelations About Detangling Curly Hair\n\nThe two things that makes caring for curly hair so different is that curly hair is naturally dry because the scalp’s natural oils do not move down the strands easily, and detangling improperly risks excessive breakage. Over the past four years I have tried many different ways of detangling with many different tools and products. I remember when I first started growing my hair out, I realized that if I could only find the best way to detangle my hair it would thrive.\n\nI had no idea then that it would take me a lot of time as well as trial and error to figure out what worked best for my hair. I also had no idea that my detangling method would change over time as my hair gained more length. In search for the best method, I of course followed what I saw others do because it seemed to work so well for them. I was hoping that it would also work for me. In truth I still had to find my own way. I feel that now I have finally found a method I like that works for me with consistent results.\n\nFinger Detangling\n\nThe benefits of finger detangling is that you do not disturb your natural curl pattern and that you can feel any knots in your hair while gently removing them. I’ve found that it is best to finger detangle your hair with a product or ingredient that reduces the amount of friction with your hair strands. For some that may be finger detangling their hair dry with an oil, and for others detangling their hair wet with a conditioner.\n\nOne major drawback for finger detangling is that it is very time consuming. One of my observations was that solely finger detangling created more single strand knots on the ends of my hair because my hair was never completely smoothed out. Although finger detangling is the gentlest method for removing knots and tangles from hair, it is still important to be very gentle because you can still snap strands of hair if you rush.\n\nWide Tooth Seamless Comb\n\nUsing a wide tooth seamless comb is probably one of the best tools to use when detangling curly hair. It is important to find a comb that does not have a seam that runs along the middle of each prong so that your hair can be combed without it snagging on anything. Combing curly hair also elongates that hair more than detangling with a brush which creates more curl definition. Detangling hair with a wide tooth seamless comb is one of the most beneficial detangling tools for all hair types.\n\nBrushes\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of using a brush for curly hair is that the prongs have flexibility and move as your hair glides through them. This is very unlike using a seamless comb with inflexible teeth. If you choose to use a brush it is best to seek out ones with widely set teeth and without ball tips. I’ve tried different types of brushes over the years, and have found one that I really love… a 100% bamboo brush.\n\nThis eco-friendly bamboo brush is similar in structure to the popular Denman brush, yet has a better ability distributing oils throughout the hair because of its natural bamboo wood prongs. This type of brush also has long bristles which massage and stimulate the scalp with a soft base which gives these same wooden bristles even more flexibility in movement as you brush your hair. What I’ve found with using a wooden brush for curly hair is that it does not disturb your natural curl patten when used on wet hair. It actually smooths and defines the curls even more. I found my bamboo brush by Bass discounted at Marshalls, yet I have also seen these brushes at natural grocery stores like Whole Foods and Sprouts.\n\nFinding The Best Detangling Method & Detangling Tips\n\nI recently started deep conditioning my hair every week. If you are interested in 100% natural deep conditioning options then read this article. I’ve noticed that since deep conditioning my hair weekly, it has been so much easier to detangle my curls because my hair is fully hydrated and moisturized therefore having more elasticity. Also when using any type of detangling tool it is important to only detangle curly hair damp or wet in sections. Finger detangling hair seems to be the only method that can be safely used on dry hair. Moisturized and freshly trimmed hair is always easier to detangle.\n\nTo find the best detangling method for your curls, try different detangling tools and methods to test and observe. Over time I tried different hair methods and tools while detangling my curls standing in front of the bathroom sink to notice if any tiny hairs broke off in the sink, as well as under running water in the shower to see if the water stream helped effectively. Based on my observed results over time I had a much better idea what was working and what was not.\n\nI’ve also noticed that when I set my curls in twists or braids the detangling process is much easier on wash day because of the organized setting method versus simply letting my hair dry freely and wearing it that way. I still believe that a gentle and effective detangling process is crucial for the health and overall appearance of curly hair. It just takes some trial and error to figure out exactly what works for you.\n\nYou can see my latest hair care products here.

For more about Dawn Michelle go here!\n\nHi Dawn Michelle! First time commenting (been following for about a month or so?). I have been having a lot of ups and downs with my curly hair since I have stopped using conventional products. So excited to find you because I am now convinced to use henna…for both the color and conditioning.\n\nAnd regarding the blog post…I rarely take a brush to my hair, just fingers. The reason is laziness. :p I am also trying to do a gentle scalp scratch a few times a week.\n\nHi Michelle,\nThanks for your comment! It takes time to figure out the best way to care for curly hair. It’s fine to only finger detangle if that works for you. I stopped solely finger detangling myself because it took me hours to complete. I still take my time detangling my hair with my bamboo brush but I don’t rush through it. If you need ideas for developing a natural hair regimen you can check out this article and my fall/winter 2013 hair regimen too. I plan to post an updated regimen for spring/summer soon.\nHave a beautiful day!\n\nI have thick curly hair thats starting to reach my bra strap. So over the last 2 years ive been trying different things as well, for me its best when i detangle in the shower a bit, then i shampoo and after the conditioner has soaked in a bit i detangle the smaller knots under the running water. Im very careful and after im done, i pat it dry, put my conditioners and oils through and make sure its sitting right. It takes awhile but my hairs my hobby, and i enjoy nursing it.\n\nDM I wanted to comment to tell you how beautiful you are and how I love everything about your blog. I’ve found it Feb 14 & about 3 weeks ago I tried your Green tea cleansing recipe and you were right, that stuff is actually amazing ( or at least that’s the way my scalp feels!!) I will tell you the truth, my hair loved every part of it and my scalp (!!!) problems were instantly solved with spraying aloe vera juice after I rinsed it out. Then I double stand twisted my hair using a lil Shea butter & thanks to you I found exactly what my hair needs THANK YOU!!! I AM ABSOLUTELY AM DONE WITH STORE BOUGHT PRODUCTS & I found something my hair loves:Herbal Green Tea cleanser!!!!!!!!!!! I followed you recipe pretty close I wonder if I can make the tea more stronger by using less water (I used 2 cups)\nAlso I can’t wait to try henna (I never knew the hair benefits at all) I totally trust that I will like it too, and your other herbal & leave-ins….Thanks again im glad I don’t have to search anymore I will just come straight here for all of my natural hair needs!! Tall to ya soon!\n\nHi Safarrii,\nThank you so much, you are a sweetheart! I’m am thrilled that you’ve found a simple hair regimen that works for you. You seriously don’t have to use a bunch of hair products to achieve the healthy and beautiful results desired. Also I wouldn’t make a stronger solution for the hair rinse as you want to keep the pH only slightly acidic versus it becoming too acidic. Wishing you the very best and again thanks so much for sharing this with us!\n\nI dont know if it is the henna but since i started using it (now with indigo though to make it more brown than red), my hair detangles so quickly and easily. I use a wide tooth comb. Before it took much longer. I think it is thanks to your blog and advise about henna. I have shoulder lenght (if pulled) 4a hair and the detangling under the shower with comditioner barely takes 1minute. It is like magical. I used to do finger combing when my hair was shorterand it took me a while. Even with a wide tooth comb, it too long. Yet, now that hair is longer, the detangling process is a breeze. You were right in saying henna helps makes your hair more manageable.\n\nI make my hair curly…very curly and there is NO way to detangle without puffing it all up so that it is huge…So I only detangle before I wash it…brush it out ends first then work my way up…when it is all detangled I wash and condition and let it air dry…works great. I do run around with wet hair sometimes but who cares. In between I mist my hair then comb it with a pick when it is damp. I would never do anything to dry hair unless I want it to be poofy.\n\nHi Brianna,\nThanks so much for sharing what works for you! Curly hair is so unique. It is always interesting to see all of the different techniques that we all use to get our desired results. Wishing you only the very best!\n\nI no longer use conventional conditioners. I use an ACV rinse as a replacement. It helps me detangle my curly hair easily and doesn’t leave that coated feeling that conditioners do. Would it be alright to leave a bottle of prediluted ACV and water mixture in the shower? or do I have to make a new batch everytime I wash my hair?\n\nI usually mix a new bottle of diluted ACV on the days I wash my hair. Whatever is leftover I place in the refrigerator. Vinegar is a natural preservative so I’m assuming that if you use distilled water in your mix you could leave it in the shower. I always just put things in the fridge just in case.\n\nI have been using the wood comb from The Body Shop for about a year now. It works, I have noticed less breakage and single strand knots compared to a wide tooth plastic seamed comb. I could use a horrible conditioner and would still get less breakage than if I used a normal comb. I have noticed that detangling on pre stretched hair also works for me. Finger detangling to remove major knots then combing has so far been the best technique. It still takes me about 45 mins, but that due to dense long hair and I have a sensitive scalp due to allergies.\n\nHi Dianne,\nSeamless hair tools are definitely the best options. Also finger detangling has been the best thing I’ve incorporated in my regimen. Even during the times I stopped I always go back.

Sure, it's easy to produce some numbers that say something about the performance of your software, but unless it was calculated using a very accurate representation of the actual usage patterns of your end users, it might be completely different from the actual results you will get in the wild. Websites are notoriously hard to benchmark correctly. Sure, you can run a script that measures the time it takes to generate a page but it will be a very different number from what you will see under real world usage.\nInorder to create a solid benchmark of what your servers can handle, you first need to figure out what the usage patterns of your users is. If your site is already running, you can easily collect this data from your logs. Next, you need to create a simulation that will emulate exactly the same patterns as your real users exhibit... that is - view front page, login, view status page and so forth. Different pages will create a different load on the servers requiring that you actually fetch correct set of pages when simulating load on your servers. Finally, you need to figure out which resources are cached by your users, you can do this again by looking through your access log or using a tool such as firebug.\n\nA:\n\nJMeter, ab, or httperf\n\nA:\n\nJason, Have you  looked at the Load Test built in to Visual Studio 2008 Team System?

{"text": "Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western World. As this is mostly related to disorders of the blood supply to the heart, it is very important to be able to assess the perfusion of the heart wall. Conventional methods for assessing myocardial perfusion have many limitations, including relatively low resolution and poor ability to provide quantitative data. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the \"first-pass\" kinetics of contrast enhancement by a bolus injection of contrast agent is a very promising method for noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion, with higher resolution than conventional radionuclide imaging methods. However, current approaches to MRI perfusion studies have only been \"semiquantitative\", due to several technical difficulties. We have been achieving very encouraging initial results in making absolute measurements of regional myocardial perfusion, using novel MRI methods that we have designed to overcome the limitations of conventional MRI approaches. In the proposed research, we will further develop our MRI methods, and the associated image analysis methods, for quantitatively measuring myocardial perfusion. We will perform a series of studies on normal subjects to establish the expected range of variability of the results. We will also perform a series of studies of patients with coronary artery disease, comparing the results of our MRI methods with those of conventional methods used to assess the blood supply to the heart, including radionuclide imaging, CT angiography and conventional cardiac catheterization (including invasive measures of flow reserve). The significance of the proposed work is its potential to achieve more accurate and higher resolution assessments of blood flow to the heart wall than current conventional methods can provide. This would be very useful for aiding treatment decisions and for following the results of therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease, a common and serious clinical condition. The quantitative MRI methods we propose to develop for the assessment of cardiac vascular disease may also be applicable to assessment of the perfusion of other important organs, such as the brain, which is subject to stroke, and in other important disease processes, such as cancer, where the disease evolution may be related to blood flow.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Because the right of appeal from courts not of record\nis the right to a trial or hearing de novo in district court, N.M. Const. Art. VI, § 27; State v.\nHicks, 1986-NMCA-129, ¶ 6, 105 N.M. 286, 731 P.2d 982, we conclude that the district\ncourt must make an independent determination of the merits of the pretrial motion, id.; State\nv. Foster, 2003-NMCA-099, ¶ 19, 134 N.M. 224, 75 P.3d 824.\n\n{2}     If district courts are not permitted to review a lower court’s grant or denial of\npotentially dispositive pretrial motions on appeal, the power of lower courts to grant relief\nwhen constitutional safeguards and procedural rules, such as speedy trial, double jeopardy,\nor discovery rules, are violated would be meaningless. In addition, parties in courts of\nlimited jurisdiction who believe they are entitled to a dispositive order as a remedy for a\nconstitutional or procedural violation would effectively be deprived of the safeguards of the\nUnited States and New Mexico Constitutions and our procedural rules if a district court’s de\nnovo review of the lower court’s ruling are bypassed in favor of a trial de novo on the\nunderlying complaint.\n\n{3}       In this case, the district court rejected Juan Piñon-Garcia’s (Piñon-Garcia) request\nfor it to review a municipal court dismissal for an abuse of discretion. The district court also\ndeclined to independently consider Piñon-Garcia’s motion to dismiss because the court\nbelieved it was compelled to proceed directly to a trial de novo. The Court of Appeals\nreversed on this issue. We affirm the Court of Appeals on the second issue and reverse the\ndistrict court, remanding for its independent consideration of the motion to dismiss.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n{4}      In January 2009, Piñon-Garcia was arrested and charged in Farmington Municipal\nCourt with three traffic offenses in violation of Farmington municipal ordinances. Piñon-\nGarcia pleaded not guilty to the charges. During the pretrial conference held on March 19,\n2009, the municipal court entered an order scheduling a trial for May 5, 2009. On the notice\nof trial setting and order to appear, the municipal court ordered the arresting officer, Virgil\nTodacheeney (Officer Todacheeney), to appear at the trial, stating that if he did not appear,\na warrant would be issued for his arrest.\n\n{5}    On the scheduled trial date, the municipal court granted Piñon-Garcia’s pretrial\nmotion to dismiss all three charges, including a DWI charge, because Officer Todacheeney,\nwho was the only witness to observe Piñon-Garcia driving and who administered Piñon-\n\n                                               2\n\fGarcia’s breath alcohol test, did not appear. The City of Farmington (the City) appealed only\nthe dismissal of the DWI charge to the district court for a trial de novo. During a pretrial\nhearing before the district court, Piñon-Garcia moved to dismiss the appeal, or alternatively\nto affirm the municipal court’s dismissal of the charges. He argued that under State v.\nCandelaria, 2008-NMCA-120, ¶¶ 12, 15, 144 N.M. 797, 192 P.3d 792, the district court\nmust review the dismissal for an abuse of discretion. The district court denied Piñon-\nGarcia’s motion, stating in its order:\n\n       It is undisputed that the officer who arrested the Defendant for driving while\n       under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs did not appear for trial\n       below in the Farmington Municipal Court on May 5, 2009. Upon\n       Defendant’s oral motion to dismiss at that time, the municipal court judge\n       dismissed the charges against the Defendant with prejudice. The parties agree\n       that for constitutional purposes, jeopardy had not attached.\n\nThe district court concluded that New Mexico Constitution Article VI, Section 27 precluded\nit from reviewing the municipal court order for an abuse of discretion, but rather required\nthe district court to hold a trial de novo.\n\n{6}    A trial de novo was held in district court, and this time Officer Todacheeney\nappeared and testified. Piñon-Garcia was convicted of a first offense, non-aggravated DWI.\nHe appealed to the Court of Appeals, contending that the district court should have reviewed\nthe municipal court’s order of dismissal for an abuse of discretion. City of Farmington v.\nPinon-Garcia, 2012-NMCA-079, ¶¶ 4, 6, 284 P.3d 1086.\n\n{7}      The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the district court for a de\nnovo review of the propriety of the municipal court’s dismissal before proceeding to a trial\nde novo. Id. ¶¶ 1, 7. Both parties filed petitions for certiorari, which we granted. On appeal\nto this Court, Piñon-Garcia continues to assert that rulings by a municipal court pursuant to\nits inherent authority should be reviewed on appeal by the district court for abuse of\ndiscretion. The City argues that we should reverse the Court of Appeals because the district\ncourt conducted a proper de novo review of the municipal court’s order of dismissal. The\nCity also asks this Court to set forth specific guidelines for a district court’s de novo review\nof pretrial motions.\n\nAUTHORITY OF MUNICIPAL COURTS\n\n{8}     “Each municipal court has jurisdiction over all offenses and complaints under\nordinances of the municipality and may issue subpoenas and warrants and punish for\ncontempt.” NMSA 1978, § 35-14-2(A) (1988). In addition, we have promulgated the Rules\nof Procedure for the Municipal Courts that govern the practice in those courts. See Rules 8-\n101 to 8-802 NMRA. As part of these rules, we have (1) empowered municipal court judges\nto sanction parties for the violation of discovery orders, which includes the authority to\ndismiss a case, Rule 8-504(F)(5) (such other order as it deems appropriate); (2) explained\n\n                                               3\n\ftheir contempt power, Rule 8-110; and (3) authorized municipal judges to dismiss with\nprejudice a complaint or a citation filed against an individual if that person is not brought to\ntrial within the time limits of our rules, Rule 8-506(E). Municipal court judges also must\nuphold the Constitutions of the United States and the State of New Mexico. N.M. Const. art.\nXX, § 1.\n\nAPPEALS FROM MUNICIPAL COURTS TO DISTRICT COURTS CALL FOR\nHEARINGS OR TRIALS DE NOVO\n\n{9}      The final judgments and decisions of a municipal court may be appealed to the\ndistrict court for a trial de novo. N.M. Const. art. VI, § 27 (“Appeals shall be allowed in all\ncases from the final judgments and decisions of . . . inferior courts to the district courts, and\nin all such appeals, trial shall be had de novo unless otherwise provided by law.”). In a de\nnovo appeal, the general rule is that a district court conducts a new trial as if the trial in the\nlower court had not occurred. NMSA 1978, § 39-3-1 (1955) (“All appeals from inferior\ntribunals to the district courts shall be tried anew in said courts on their merits, as if no trial\nhad been had below, except as otherwise provided by law.” (emphasis added)); State v.\nTrujillo, 1999-NMCA-003, ¶ 4, 126 N.M. 603, 973 P.2d 855. However, when raised by a\nparty, district courts also consider pretrial motions in de novo appeals. Foster, 2003-NMCA-\n099, ¶ 11 (quoting Rule 5-601(B) NMRA (“Any defense[, objection or request] which is\ncapable of determination without a trial on the merits may be raised before trial by\nmotion.”)). The duty of the district court, when a party raises a pretrial motion in a de novo\nappeal, is to make an independent determination of the merits of the motion. Foster, 2003-\nNMCA-099, ¶ 19; Hicks, 1986-NMCA-129, ¶ 6.\n\n{10} For example, in Foster, the defendant was tried in magistrate court, a court not of\nrecord, on a charge of aggravated DWI. 2003-NMCA-099, ¶¶ 1, 3. During the trial, defense\ncounsel posed a question to a witness that resulted in the magistrate court judge granting a\nmistrial to the state. Id. ¶ 3. The following day, the state asked the judge to enter an order\nfinding manifest necessity for the mistrial so that the defendant could be retried. Id. ¶¶ 3, 7.\nOver the defendant’s objection, the magistrate court judge granted the state’s motion. Id. ¶\n3. The defendant was subsequently tried and convicted. Id. ¶ 4. He appealed to the district\ncourt for a trial de novo and filed a pretrial motion with the district court to dismiss the\ncomplaint on double jeopardy grounds because there was not manifest necessity for granting\nthe mistrial. Id. ¶¶ 3, 4; see State v. Martinez, 1995-NMSC-064, ¶ 8, 120 N.M. 677, 905 P.2d\n715 (stating that when a mistrial is granted over the defendant’s objection, retrial is not\nbarred if the court finds manifest necessity). The district court denied the defendant’s motion\nbecause it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to review events that transpired in\nmagistrate court. Foster, 2003-NMCA-099, ¶ 5.\n\n{11} On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the district court to\nindependently review, de novo, the merits of the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Id. ¶¶ 19-20.\nThe Foster court cited several cases as examples of a district court’s jurisdiction to review\nthe merits of motions filed in lower courts. Id. ¶ 11 (citing “[State v.] Wilson, 1998-NMCA-\n\n                                                4\n\f084, ¶ 20, 125 N.M. 390, 962 P.2d 636 (remanding to district court for hearing on\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss for speedy trial violation in magistrate court); State v. Vigil,\n114 N.M. 431, 433, 839 P.2d 641, 643 (Ct.App. 1992) (considering trial court’s grant of\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss for violation of six-month rule in magistrate court); State v.\nHicks, 105 N.M. 286, 287, 731 P.2d 982, 983 (Ct.App.1986) (‘[T]he right of appeal [from\ncourts not of record] . . . is the right to a trial or hearing de novo in the district court.’)”).\nFoster and the cases cited therein by the Court of Appeals provide ample authority for the\nproposition that district courts can and must review, de novo, the merits of pretrial motions\nbrought before them on appeal from courts not of record, which includes municipal courts.\nSee Foster, 2003-NMCA-099, ¶¶ 8-9, 11.\n\n{12} Simply because municipal courts are not courts of record does not mean that the\nentire history of a case in municipal court is disregarded. When a municipal court ruling is\nappealed to district court, the record on appeal consists of, among other things, copies of all\npapers or pleadings filed in the municipal court, copies of the judgment or final order to be\nreviewed, and any exhibits filed in the proceedings. Rule 5-826(F) NMRA. In addition, with\nthe prior approval of the municipal judge, the parties, at their own expense, may make a\nrecord of the testimony in the municipal court proceeding. Rule 8-601(D). Transcripts from\ncriminal proceedings in courts of limited jurisdiction may be “considered insofar as is\nnecessary for a meaningful review of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.”\nFoster, 2003-NMCA-099, ¶ 16. The record on appeal establishes what issues were preserved\nin the lower court and facilitates a district court’s de novo review of such issues.\n\n{13} Permitting a party to ask a district court to consider the merits of a dispositive pretrial\nmotion filed in municipal court is important if we are to give true meaning to the power\nvested in municipal courts to enforce our procedural rules and the protections of the United\nStates and New Mexico Constitutions. Examples of dispositive motions in municipal court\ninclude speedy trial violations, six-month rule violations, double jeopardy violations, and\ndiscovery violations. If a municipality is guaranteed a new trial on appeal, regardless of its\nviolation of procedural rules or violations of the United States or New Mexico Constitutions,\na municipal court’s order enforcing the rule violations would be meaningless. In addition,\nthe municipal court could arbitrarily disregard enforcement of procedural rules and\nconstitutional protections, knowing that whatever it does will not be reviewed, because on\nappeal the district court must grant the appealing party a new trial, as if the municipal court\nproceeding had never taken place. This situation would lead to an absurd interpretation of\nthe will of the voters who adopted Article VI, Section 27 of the New Mexico Constitution,\nand we will not interpret our Constitution to lead to absurd results. See State v. Boyse, 2013-\nNMSC-024, ¶¶ 8-9, 303 P.3d 830.\n\n{14} However, we reject Piñon-Garcia’s argument that Candelaria, 2008-NMCA-120,\nrequired the district court to review the municipal court’s dismissal for an abuse of\ndiscretion. In Candelaria, the State appealed the metropolitan court’s dismissal of charges\nagainst a defendant who was charged with battery of a household member. Id. ¶¶ 1-2. The\nhearing in metropolitan court was on record because the charges involved domestic violence.\n\n                                                5\n\fId. ¶ 10. Therefore, on appeal to the district court, the district court sat as an appellate court,\nreviewing the metropolitan court’s dismissal for an abuse of discretion. Id. ¶¶ 10, 12.\n\n{15} The important distinction between Candelaria and this case is the role of the district\ncourt in the respective cases. In Candelaria, the district court sat as an appellate court\nbecause the metropolitan court proceedings were on record. Id. ¶ 10; see Foster, 2003-\nNMCA-099, ¶ 9 (“If an appeal is on record, the district court acts as a typical appellate court\nreviewing the record of the lower court’s trial for legal error.”). In this case, the proceedings\nin municipal court were not on the record, and therefore the appeal to the district court was\nfor a trial or hearing de novo. See Hicks, 1986-NMCA-129, ¶ 6 (“[T]he right of appeal [from\na court not of record] is the right to a trial or hearing de novo in the district court.”).\nTherefore, Candelaria is inapposite.\n\n{16} However, the City’s reliance on City of Las Cruces v. Sanchez, 2007-NMSC-042, ¶\n20, 142 N.M. 243, 164 P.3d 942 for the broad proposition that an appeal from municipal\ncourt to district court always requires a new trial is misplaced. In Sanchez, the City of Las\nCruces appealed a municipal court’s mid-trial dismissal of charges to the district court. Id.\n¶ 1. The defendant challenged the municipality’s ability to appeal to the district court for a\ntrial de novo. Id. ¶¶ 4-5. This Court framed the question presented as “whether a district\ncourt has jurisdiction to entertain a city’s appeal from a municipal court’s dismissal of\ncharges against a defendant on grounds other than the constitutionality of an ordinance or\nthe sufficiency of a complaint.” Id. ¶ 7. We relied on New Mexico Constitution Article VI,\nSection 27, which provides that “[a]ppeals shall be allowed in all cases from the final\njudgments and decisions of . . . inferior courts to the district courts, and in all such appeals,\ntrial shall be had de novo unless otherwise provided by law.” Sanchez, 2007-NMSC-042, ¶\n15. We held that a municipality has “a constitutional right to appeal an adverse final\njudgment or decision from a municipal court” based on Article VI, Section 27. Sanchez,\n2007-NMSC-042, ¶ 15. However, we acknowledged that a municipality’s right to appeal is\nlimited by the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and New Mexico Constitutions.\nId. (qualifying the city’s right to appeal,“[p]rovided a defendant’s right to be free from\ndouble jeopardy is not violated”).\n\n{17} Therefore, Sanchez is only relevant to this case insofar as it supports the City’s\nargument that it is entitled to appeal the municipal court’s dismissal to district court. Sanchez\ndoes not, however, support the argument that the City is automatically entitled to a trial de\nnovo. The limited question we address in this case is the appropriate review in district court\nof a municipal court’s pretrial ruling. Although it did not address this issue in Sanchez, the\nCourt of Appeals addressed this issue many years ago in both Foster and Hicks. These two\ncases establish that, if a party raises a pretrial motion in a de novo appeal, the district court\nmust make an independent, i.e., de novo, determination of the merits of the motion. Foster,\n2003-NMCA-099, ¶ 19; Hicks, 1986-NMCA-129, ¶ 6.\n\n{18} Piñon-Garcia has not provided us with any authority that supports his argument that\nthe district court in this case should have reviewed the municipal court’s dismissal for an\n\n                                                6\n\fabuse of discretion. Accordingly, we decline to stray from precedent and conclude that when\na party raises a municipal court’s ruling before the district court on appeal, the district court\nmust consider, de novo, the merits of the motion preserved below and rule accordingly. In\nthis case, the City had the right to appeal the dismissal of the case, and Piñon-Garcia had the\nright to have the district court consider, de novo, the merits of his motion to dismiss the\nappeal, or alternatively to affirm the municipal court’s dismissal. If, based on its own\nindependent review, the district court concludes that dismissal of the case because of Officer\nTodacheeney’s failure to appear was not warranted, the City would be entitled to a trial de\nnovo in district court.\n\n{19} Finally, we address the City’s request to clarify what is required of district courts\nwhen conducting de novo reviews of decisions from courts that are not of record. The Hicks\ncourt explained that “[i]n de novo proceedings, the district court is not in any way bound by\nthe proceedings in the lower court.” 1986-NMCA-129, ¶ 6. We agree with this statement.\nTherefore, when a district court reviews a lower court’s grant or denial of a dispositive\npretrial motion, it does so independently. Id. (concluding that the district court was required\nto make an independent determination of the merits of a motion raised in a lower court,\nrather than reviewing for an abuse of discretion). The district court does not consider\nwhether the lower court abused its discretion; rather, it must consider the merits of the\nmotion without regard to what the municipal court decided. See City of Farmington v.\nSandoval, 1977-NMCA-022, ¶ 16, 90 N.M. 246, 561 P.2d 945 (explaining that in a de novo\nreview, the reviewing court does not review “the correctness of the proceedings” in the\nlower court).\n\n{20} In this case, the district court did not address the double jeopardy issue because the\nparties agreed that jeopardy had not attached before the municipal judge dismissed the case\nwith prejudice. This agreement is supported by law because in non-jury trials, jeopardy\nattaches when the court hears some evidence from the prosecution. State v. Nunez, 2000-\nNMSC-013, ¶ 28, 129 N.M. 63, 2 P.3d 264. The City listed two Farmington police officers\nas witnesses who would be called at trial. Officer Todacheeney, who was the only witness\nwho observed Piñon-Garcia drive while impaired and who administered Piñon-Garcia’s\nbreath alcohol test, was not present to testify. The record reflects that the municipal court\ndismissed the case, as opposed to acquitting Piñon-Garcia for lack of evidence, and the\nparties agree that this occurred before the municipal court called the City to present\nevidence. Therefore, double jeopardy had not attached, id., and the district court was correct\nnot to consider the double jeopardy issue any further.\n\n{21} The district court also correctly concluded that it did not have to review the\nmunicipal court’s order of dismissal for an abuse of discretion. However, the district court\nshould have made an independent determination regarding the validity of the municipal\ncourt’s order of dismissal based on the record on appeal and the arguments of counsel at the\ndistrict court level. The district court must resolve whether it would dismiss the case because\nOfficer Todacheeney failed to appear at trial or if it would consider alternatives to dismissing\nthe case with prejudice, while balancing the need to vindicate the authority of the municipal\n\n                                               7\n\fcourt and protecting the parties’ rights under our rules and the United States and New\nMexico Constitutions. We remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{22} Because the right of appeal from courts not of record is the right to a trial or hearing\nde novo in district court, we conclude that the district court must make an independent\ndetermination, de novo, of the merits of any pretrial motions raised by the parties. In this\ncase, the district court declined to conduct a de novo review of the merits of Piñon-Garcia’s\npretrial motion. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the district court\nfor its independent determination of the merits of Piñon-Garcia’s motion to dismiss.\n\n{23}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              EDWARD L.

{"text": "SERVICES\n\nFoundation Background\n\nTETAF was created after the Texas Legislature passed laws prohibiting the state from providing services offered by other entities, even national entities. In the case of the trauma designation process, the state turned to the American College of Surgeons to provide verification surveys for all levels of trauma centers. In 2006, concerned with the high cost of ACS survey services, the Texas trauma community – with strong support from the 22 trauma regional advisory councils (RACs) – launched the Texas EMS, Trauma and Acute Care Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. TETAF provides operational support and helps fill the gap when federal, state and local governments and private entities cannot provide services on a statewide basis. TETAF was granted authority by the Texas Department of State Health Services in 2008 to provide verification surveys for Level III and Level IV designated trauma facilities, and in 2009 the first TETAF staff was hired to begin fully implementing TETAF’s mission.\nTETAF has recently released a new document providing information and answering questions about the TETAF survey process to help hospitals and Trauma Program Managers. Click here to access this helpful FAQ document.\n\nPartnering with the Texas Department of State Health Services, TETAF staff provides technical assistance resources in program development as well as coordination of survey services to ensure a successful Stroke Support Facility (Level III) designation process.\n\nPartnering with the Texas Department of State Health Services, TETAF staff provides technical assistance resources in trauma program development as well as coordination of survey services to ensure a successful designation process.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Clinical and angiographic correlates and prognostic significance of the coronary extent score.\nThe clinical and angiographic correlates and the prognostic significance of the \"coronary extent score\" in a consecutive series of 313 patients who were catheterized twice were studied. The extent score was defined as the number of 5 to 75% stenosed segments in a 15-segment coding system. The extent score was higher in subgroups of patients with new onset angina at the time of the first angiogram (4.3 +/- 2.4 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.01), unstable angina at the time of the second angiogram (4.0 +/- 2.0 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.05) or multifocal progression from the first to the second angiogram (4.0 +/- 2.1 vs 3.3 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.01), suggesting that it is an index of active coronary artery disease. The extent score did not correlate with the number of diseased vessels (r = 0.03), the ejection fraction (r = 0.03), the Friesinger score (r = 0.04) and the Gensini score (r = -0.07) (difference not significant for each). Cox's model was fit to the survival data recorded on a prospective basis after the second angiogram. Independent predictors of survival were ejection fraction (p less than 0.001), extent score (p = 0.001), number of diseased vessels (p = 0.01) and percent of left main luminal stenosis (p less than 0.05). The extent score was also an independent predictor of myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Thus, the extent score, an index of active progressive disease, is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

for a while so...\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"We have this whole new mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back samples all week.\" \"So I see.\" \"Anything interesting?\" \"Well, it's all pretty similar to what we found back on Lantea.\" \" We found a few new species.\" \" Mmm.\" \"Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you.\" \"I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.\" \"What is that?\" \"Well, it doesn't have a name yet, but I'm thinking of calling it\" \"Rodneyana villosa.\" \"After you.\" \" Really?\" \"What...\" \"You can do that?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Be careful.\" \"The bristles will pierce skin.\" \"Oh.\" \"Anyway, look, I wondered if I could, you know, tear you away from all of this long enough to have some lunch.\" \" I would...\" \"I would love to...\" \" Oh.\" \"...but I think I'm coming down with something.\" \"I have a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary.\" \"Oh...\" \"Well, I'll come with you.\"

this really bad headache that won't go away, and I...\" \"I feel kind of dizzy.\" \" When did you first notice it?\" \" Sometime this morning.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms, and the second person from the botany department.\" \" Gerald?\" \"Hey.\" \" Who's that?\" \"Gerald Baxter.\" \"He's on my team.\" \"You've met him before.\" \"He's got the bug collection.\" \"Oh.\" \"Sure, right, yeah.\" \"I remember now.\" \"Well, I'm going to need to take some blood.\" \"You, too, Doctor.\" \" What?\" \" Lf there is something going around, you might have been exposed to it as well.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Major Dorsey and his team just returned from M6R-214.\" \"They examined the debris field above the planet and found the parts from one, possibly two, Replicator ships.\" \"It was just a matter of time before the Wraith got organized\" \" and started hitting back.\" \" I suppose.\" \"They did defeat the Ancients, after all.\" \"The Replicators may look like the Ancients, and they may use the same technology, but they're going to be a lot tougher to put down.\" \"Colonel Carter, come in, please.\" \"Go ahead, Doctor.\" \"I've got a situation developing.\" \"Be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.\" \"What's going on?\" \"Eleven patients have shown up here in the last hour complaining of headache and dizziness.\" \"Eight of them are from the survey teams that just got back from the mainland.\" \"Any idea what's wrong with them?\" \"I ran some blood tests, and found a bacteria I've never seen before.\" \"I'm checking it against the Ancient database.\" \" What do you want us to do?\" \" Well, the first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland, and have them report to Dr. Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing.\" \"Will do.\" \"Keep us posted.\" \"More test results.\" \"You and I are both infected.\" \"So's Dr. McKay.\" \"The good news is the most advanced case is still only showing mild, flu-like symptoms.\" \" Maybe it won't get any worse than that.\" \" Yeah, let's hope so.\" \"Hello?\" \"Hey.\" \"Hey, wake up.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"I don't know.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"You're not a soldier.\" \"If you say so.\" \" You should come with me.\" \"It's safe.\" \" No, slow down.\" \"What's going on here?\" \"It's the soldiers.\" \"They're after us.\" \"If they catch us, they'll take us away.\" \"Take us where?\" \"What soldiers?\" \"What is this place?\" \"Will you shut up?\" \"The soldiers will hear us.\" \"What the hell is going on here?\" \"Why can't I remember anything?\" \"I don't know.\" \"No one can.\" \"No one can.\" \" You've seen others?\" \" Yes, one or two others.\" \" Apart from the soldiers.\" \" What about her?\" \"Was she there?\" \" No.\" \" I have to find her.\" \" Why?\" \" I don't know.\" \"It's important.\" \"Look, the soldiers probably have her by now, okay?\" \" Well, can we ask them?\" \" Are you crazy?\" \"If the soldiers see you, they shoot you, they take you away.\" \"Again with the taking away.\" \"Look, you should come hide with me.\" \"It's safe.\" \" I can't, I have to keep looking.\" \" Fine, suit yourself.\" \"If you get yourself killed, I don't care.\" \"It started suddenly, and then it just...\" \"Just stopped.\" \" Okay, well, I appreciate you telling me.\" \" Aren't you going to do anything?\" \"To be honest, I don't see how it's relevant.\" \"Well, it's a new symptom.\" \"I thought it might be important.\" \"I don't see how a tingling sensation in your knees relates to this condition, especially since you're the only one experiencing it.\" \"Yeah, but so far.\" \"I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease.\" \"Look, the best thing for you to do right now is try to relax, okay?\" \"And let me do my work.\" \" Here you go.\" \" Thank you.\" \"What did Dr. Keller say?\" \"Oh, she's going to take it into consideration, thanked me for my input and...\" \"How you doing?\" \"Thanked me for my input and...\" \"How you doing?\" \"I'm okay.\" \"Well, Dr. Keller's got her team working pretty hard.\" \"I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff.\" \"I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.\" \" Seriously, are you okay?\" \" It's...\" \"My headache.\" \"It's getting worse.\" \"All right, look, is there anything I can do?\" \"Could you ask the nurse to bring me some tea?\" \"Well, what's wrong with this one?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Right.\" \"Marie?\" \"What's...\" \"What's going on?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I just got really dizzy.\" \"Are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol?\" \"I'm not entirely sure.\" \"It's possible she could have been previously exposed, but that would mean it's already spread much farther among the general population than we thought.\" \"I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the city just to get a sense of where we're at.\" \"Have we confirmed it came from the mainland?\" \"Well, the plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative, but it still seems like the most likely point of origin.\" \"What about the database?\" \"I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still looking.\" \"There is one more thing.\" \"Since we have no idea what this disease does, or how it's spread, or even if our containment measures are having any effect,\" \"I recommend we suspend all Gate travel immediately.\" \"Thank you, Doctor.\" \"Hey.\" \"How you feeling?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Oh.\" \"Well, they brought dinner.\" \"This Salisbury steak's actually quite good.\" \"Oh, and by the way, I asked Dr. Keller about your friend Dr. Baxter.\" \"She says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down.\" \" Who?\" \" Dr. Baxter.\" \"That's his name, right, the guy on your team?\" \"Katie?\" \"Where am I?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You're in the infirmary.\" \"I brought you here, remember?\" \"Who are you?\" \"Hey!\" \"Hold it right there.\" \"I don't want to cause any trouble.\" \"I just...\" \"Yeah, put him with the others.\" \"Go on, get him out of here.\" \"Come on.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, what's the word?\" \"Well, the random test results came back.\" \"Six different people working in six different areas of the city, all positive.\" \"That doesn't sound very promising.\" \"Well, it's either a statistical miracle, or the entire base has been exposed.\" \"We're running more tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.\" \"I don't know about you, but I feel fine.\" \"Well, me, too.\" \"And that's the problem.\" \"If there is a delay before the first symptoms appear, it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening.\" \"I've informed Stargate Command that we're suspending Gate operations.\" \"Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller.\" \" Go ahead.\" \" I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown as well three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia.\" \"All of them show large concentrations of affected cells in the medial temporal lobe.\" \"It looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory.\" \"How bad are we talking?\" \"Well, rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient, but in all cases, it looks like it's progressive, meaning the longer they go without treatment, the worse it gets.\" \"Pretty soon, they won't be able to remember their own names.\" \"You said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness.\" \"Yeah, that's right.\" \"How long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss?\" \"Again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an average of about six hours.\" \"What about you, Doc?\" \"Showing any signs?\" \"Yeah, the headache started half an hour ago.\" \"All right, keep searching the database.\" \"I think it's our best bet to find a solution.\" \"I'd love to, but if we're right about these numbers,\" \"I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients.\" \"It's already pretty crowded in here.\" \"Mess hall.\" \"We can clear it out and make a temporary ward.\" \"Yeah, that's a good idea.\" \"At the very least, it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.\" \"Do it.\" \" Are you all right?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Where am I?\" \"We were hoping you could tell us.\" \"Who are all you people?\" \" We don't know.\" \" None of us can remember anything.\" \"What's happening out there?\" \"What did you see?\" \"Nothing.\" \"It was just...\" \"Empty hallways.\" \"How did I get here?\" \" The soldiers brought you.\" \" Why?\" \"They bring everyone here.\" \"They say it's for our own protection.\" \"Don't waste your time.\" \"It won't open.\" \"Why are they doing this to us?\" \"Look, why can't anyone remember?\" \"My...\" \"The computer.\" \"Where's my computer?\" \"It wasn't with you when they brought you here.\" \"Why?\" \"I have to find someone.\" \"It's a woman.\" \"Teyla.\" \"Do you know who that is?\" \"Does anyone here know Teyla?\" \"Anyone?\" \"I thought this city had some sort of automatic lockdown\" \" to prevent stuff like this.\" \" It does.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"What happened?\" \"You're asking me?\" \"You got a headache?\" \"Yeah, I guess it was just a matter of time, huh?\" \" John?\" \" I'm fine.\" \"Hey.\" \"How you feeling?\" \"I am fine.\" \" Any symptoms?\" \" No, none yet.\" \"Me neither.\" \" What is it?\" \" How do they know we're all infected?\" \"My blood wasn't part of the sample that was tested.\" \"Nor was mine.\" \"Even so, it is likely we were exposed.\" \"So?\" \"Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it.\" \"Maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way.\" \"And all I know is I feel great.\" \"So do I.\" \"Perhaps you should make Dr. Keller aware of this.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Dr. Keller.\" \" I need to talk to you.\" \" I'm a little busy right now.\" \"I'm not sick.\" \"Well, if you're lucky enough not to be exposed,\" \" you just blew it by coming in here.\" \" No, I know I've been exposed.\" \"People I've been working with all day have been getting sick, but I'm not feeling anything.\" \"Neither is Teyla.\" \"You think you might have some kind of immunity?\" \" You're the doctor.\" \" Okay.\" \"Well, I'm going to need a sample of your blood.\" \"Take as much as you need.\" \" What are you doing?\" \" I have to remember somehow.\" \"I already feel certain things slipping away.\" \" All right, now what are you doing?\" \" Getting out of here.\" \"All right, everyone!\" \"Listen up!\" \"I need to escape as quickly as possible.\" \"Does anyone know how I can do that?\" \"You can't just leave.\" \" Why not?\" \" What about the soldiers?\" \"We're just going to have to deal with them.\" \"I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them.\" \"That doesn't mean we should be running loose.\" \"We have no idea what's out there.\" \"Look, something caused this to happen, all right?\" \"And we're not going to figure it out from in here.\" \"Somewhere out there, there is a woman that...\" \"A woman named...\" \" Teyla.\" \" Teyla, right, thank you.\" \" I think she knows something.\" \" What?\" \"I don't know.\" \"We got to get out there and find out.\" \" I think we should listen to him.\" \" Why?\" \"Well, it makes sense.\" \"Why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?\" \"Why haven't there been any announcements, or any help on the way?\" \"Maybe they don't know any more than we do.\" \"We need a plan.\" \" They let you out?\" \" Well, the second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive.\" \"Didn't see much point in quarantining the infirmary anymore.\" \" You showing any signs?\" \" Headache.\" \"Yeah, same here.\" \"Five bucks says you start losing your memories first.\" \"Rodney...\" \"All right, we've got food, water and blankets.\" \"We don't have enough beds, but we're just going to have to make do.\" \"We may need to think about ordering all nonessential personnel to report to the mess hall.\" \"I mean, they're going to wind up there anyways, and this way, we won't have people with no memories\" \" wandering the hallways.\" \" That's what I'm worried about.\" \"I'll send Lorne and a team out, make sure those orders are followed.\" \"These are from Dr. Neves.\" \"They're stimulants.\" \"He thinks they may slow the effects of the memory loss.\" \"I mean, it's just a stopgap, but at least it may buy us a few hours.\" \"Do we know what's in these?\" \"Because I'm allergic to a lot of...\" \"Just take it.\" \"Hand these out to Lorne and his men.\" \"One more thing.\" \"I've ordered Dr. Zelenka to remove the Gate's main control crystal.\" \"No matter what happens, we cannot risk spreading this disease elsewhere in the galaxy, or to Earth.\" \"What happens when we all start losing our memory?\" \"Dr. Keller will come up with something before that happens.\" \"Hey.\" \"I thought we were moving everyone to the mess hall.\" \"He's our most advanced case.\" \"His vitals are too unstable.\" \"What can I do for you?\" \"I was just wondering if you found anything.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm not showing any sign of the disease, remember?\" \"Oh, well, it's possible you could have some sort of natural immunity.\" \"Doc...\" \"Stay here.\" \"I'm going to take a sample of your blood.\" \"Doc.\" \"You've already done that.\" \"It's happening to me, isn't it?\" \"Doctor, he's convulsing!\" \"Okay, give him...\" \"Midazolam, four milligrams.\" \"He's in v-fib.\" \"I need a crash cart.\" \"Charge it to 200.\" \"Clear.\" \"Charge it to 300.\" \"Clear.\" \"McKAY:\" \"Go, go!\" \"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \"This way!\" \" Okay, I think we're clear.\" \" Oh, thank God.\" \"My lungs were about to give out.\" \" So, what next?\" \" I don't know.\" \"How do we find her?\" \" Who?\" \" Teyla.\" \"The one we just risked our lives for.\" \"Right, right.\" \"I don't know.\" \"All right, we'll just have to search room by room.\" \"I mean, how big could this place possibly be?\" \" Where are you taking us?\" \" I already told you.\" \"The mess hall.\" \" I don't want to go there.\" \" Just relax.\" \"I know you're scared, but you're just going to have to trust me.\" \"It's for your own good.\" \"So much for coming quietly.\" \"Hey.\" \"Mess hall's this way.\" \"Right.\" \"Don't look at me that way.\" \"It's easy to get turned around in this place.\" \"Give me that respirator.\" \"Got it.\" \"Major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers.\" \"We're starting to get a little resistance.\" \"Yeah, they're starting to lose their memories.\" \"They probably can't understand why there's a bunch of soldiers after them.\" \"That's why I told him to take his men to the armory and equip them with stunners.\" \"I'm not sure I like the idea of us shooting at our own people.\" \"Well, we may not have a choice.\" \"Yeah, I suppose you're right.\" \"Pretty soon, there's going to be some panicked, confused people out there.\" \"Okay, carry on.\" \"What?\" \"Come with me.\" \"You might want to go easy on that stuff, Major.\" \"Sir, we need to delay this thing as much as possible.\" \"If we all go, there's no coming back.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"That's what I want to talk to you about.\" \"I got an idea.\" \" Didn't we come this way before?\" \" No.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"No.\" \"I have an idea.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"If we come back here, we'll know we've been this way before.\" \"You're presuming of course that we remember that we're the ones who put it there in the first place.\" \"I know you're out there.\" \"Drop your weapons and come out slowly.\" \"Little guy with glasses.\" \" What are you doing?\" \" Hey, I know him.\" \"Don't shoot.\" \"I don't have any weapons.\" \"Who are you?\" \"We were captured by the soldiers.\" \"We escaped.\" \"Really?\" \"Wait a second.\" \"What is that?\" \" I found it.\" \" Let me see.\" \" What is it?\" \" I don't know,\" \" but something tells me it's important.\" \" Why?\" \"I don't know.\" \" Hey, how did you know to do that?\" \" I don't know.\" \"I just did.\" \" Well, that's her.\" \"Teyla.\" \" You know her?\" \"Well, not exactly.\" \"We're looking for her.\" \"We think she can help us.\" \"Huh.\" \"But it says, \"Find her. \"\" \"How are we going to do that?\" \"This is what I wanted to show you.\" \"This is the bacteria that is causing our disease?\" \"Not exactly, but it's very similar.\" \"And you found this in the database?\" \"And you found this in the database?\" \"I stopped looking in the database.\" \"I knew there was a reason why\" \"Teyla and Ronon are the only people who've tested negative so far, and we don't have a lot of information on the Satedans, so I started looking through Dr. Beckett's records on the Athosians.\" \"This is a blood sample taken from a 10-year-old boy.\" \"He was suffering from something called...\" \"Uh...\" \"I wrote it down.\" \"Kirsan fever?\" \"Yeah, that's it.\" \"It is a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy.\" \" I had it when I was eight.\" \" I had it when I was 10.\" \"But this cannot be the same disease.\" \"Kirsan fever does not affect adults,\" \" nor does it cause memory loss.\" \" Well, that may be true, but the structure of the bacteria is too similar to ignore, and they have to be related somehow.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Maybe they are the same.\" \"That would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.\" \" How is that possible?\" \" Well, think about it.\" \"I mean, this planet didn't have a stargate until we came here.\" \"Maybe when the Ancients were first scouting this place, they accidentally brought this Kirsan fever with them.\" \"It got trapped here, and over the course of 10,000 years, it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing.\" \"That would also explain why you and Ronon aren't affected.\" \"You have antibodies built up from when you were young.\" \"Well, if they have the antibodies, then...\" \"It would take months to reverse-engineer a cure.\" \"I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.\" \"The sap of the enchuri plant.\" \"My people have used it for generations to combat Kirsan fever.\" \"It is highly effective and not much is needed.\" \" Let's go get some.\" \" Take a Jumper.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"You disabled the Gate, remember?\" \"You ordered Dr. Zelenka to take the control crystal.\" \"Where did he put it?\" \"Zelenka, this is Sheppard.\" \"Come in.\" \"Check out the rooms down

{"text": "TL;DR — Red4Sec finished, more audits coming, and an update regarding mainnet\n\nRed4Sec, our auditor for the last 7 weeks, has completed their audit and submitted their report to QRL. Red4Sec consists of a talented team that has spent much of the past 2 months poring over our code 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They were joined in parallel by our own team, also scouring our codebase for vulnerabilities and mishaps, as well as dealing with issues raised by Red4Sec as they came up.\n\nDuring the analysis, whose report runs over 200 pages, a total of 67 vulnerabilities were detected. Many of these vulnerabilities did not pose any risk by themselves and therefore have been classified as informative.\n\nAll vulnerabilities were classified according to the impact level defined by CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): critical, high, medium, low and informative.\n\nA summary of the issues per project area is described below.\n\nWhat Red4Sec covered\n\nRed4Sec’s report was exhaustive, and covered the entirety of our project space, with the exception of our Post Quantum Cryptography, which will be covered by a further audit as it’s more specialized in nature. Below is a rundown of issues raised by Red4Sec by section of our network, as well as impact level.\n\nBlockchain\n\nQRL (Python)\n\nCritical : 6 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit\n\nHigh : 3 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit\n\nMedium : 4 issues identified — 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed)\n\nLow/Informative : 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary.\n\n: 6 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit : 3 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit : 4 issues identified — 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed) : 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary.

The project code follows a methodology of safe programming and good practices. The project has great support from the team as some of the vulnerabilities have been resolved at the time they were detected by Red4Sec, mitigating the possible impact and repercussion that could cause to the project.\n\nThe whole QRL team thanks Red4Sec for their professionalism and attention to detail in improving the quality of our ecosystem.\n\nMore audits\n\nAs our codebase and ecosystem grows, it is important to continually appraise the security of our implementations.\n\nWe are, therefore, pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with X41 D-Sec GmbH to undertake a secondary security audit in the coming months. This audit will be differently focused than the Red4Sec audit, leveraging some of the specific expertise at X41 such as covering the Post Quantum Cryptography portion of QRL.\n\nMainnet Progress Update\n\nIt has been a long ride to reach our main network, and our launch is just the beginning of the overall QRL journey.\n\nA date for the launch of the QRL main network has been finalized and will be announced in the coming days.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Whether animals experience human-like emotions is controversial and of immense societal concern []. Because animals cannot provide subjective reports of how they feel, emotional state can only be inferred using physiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures []. In humans, negative feelings are reliably correlated with pessimistic cognitive biases, defined as the increased expectation of bad outcomes []. Recently, mammals [] and birds [] with poor welfare have also been found to display pessimistic-like decision making, but cognitive biases have not thus far been explored in invertebrates. Here, we ask whether honeybees display a pessimistic cognitive bias when they are subjected to an anxiety-like state induced by vigorous shaking designed to simulate a predatory attack. We show for the first time that agitated bees are more likely to classify ambiguous stimuli as predicting punishment. Shaken bees also have lower levels of hemolymph dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin. In demonstrating state-dependent modulation of categorization in bees, and thereby a cognitive component of emotion, we show that the bees' response to a negatively valenced event has more in common with that of vertebrates than previously thought. This finding reinforces the use of cognitive bias as a measure of negative emotional states across species and suggests that honeybees could be regarded as exhibiting emotions.\n\nAn integrative and functional framework for the study of animal emotion and mood.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n2 Mason G.J.

Mood and the speed of decisions about anticipated resources and hazards. Identifying the best objective measures of negative affect (i.e., emotion) in animals is currently the focus of intense debate []. One approach that has recently received considerable attention is the measurement of biases in information processing that are typical of negative affective states—so-called “cognitive biases” []. Specifically, negative affective states such as anxiety are associated with increased expectation of punishment, greater attention to potential threats, and a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as if they were threats (i.e., a “glass-half-empty” or pessimistic bias) [].\n\n15 Harding E.J.\n\nPaul E.S.\n\nMendl M.

Figure 1 Protocol for Cognitive Bias Experiment with Olfactory Conditioning of Honeybees Show full caption Honeybees were trained for six trials with each stimulus (CS) in a pseudorandomized sequence. The CS+ odor was a ratio of 1 part 1-hexanol to 9 parts 2-octanone; the CS− was a 9:1 ratio of the same two odors. After conditioning, bees were placed either in a group that was exposed to 60 s of shaking or in a control group. All bees began the testing session within 300 s of the manipulation. They were tested with each CS and three novel, intermediate ratios of the same two odors. All test trials were unreinforced, and the order of test odors was randomized across subjects. We measured cognitive biases in honeybees subjected to a manipulation designed to induce an anxiety-like state using a similar approach to that adopted in studies of vertebrates []. Prior to any affective manipulation, subjects are required to learn that one stimulus (CS+) predicts reward, whereas another in the same sensory dimension (CS−) predicts punishment (or a reward of less value). Following a manipulation of state, the subjects' judgment is probed by testing their classification of novel stimuli with sensory properties intermediate between the two trained stimuli. A pessimistic cognitive bias is manifested in an increased tendency of subjects to classify stimuli as likely to predict punishment (or a reward of less value). We were able to use the same approach to test for cognitive biases in honeybees because bees are capable of associative learning and can base judgments about novel stimuli on previous experiences []. Using an olfactory learning protocol for conditioned proboscis extension, we trained honeybees to extend their mouthparts to a two-component odor mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M sucrose) and to withhold their mouthparts from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M quinine solution or 0.3 M sucrose; Figure 1 ). The experiment comprised three conditions differing in the pairs of rewards and punishers used, to allow us to determine to what extent any differences in behavior were explained by the salience of the unconditioned stimuli (USs) used.\n\n28 Begg C.M.\n\nBegg K.S.\n\nDu Toit J.T.\n\nMills M.G.L.

Actual (untransformed) mean values are as follows: DA, x ¯ unstressed = 8.42 ± 3.05 μM, stressed = 4.30 ± 1.75 μM; OA, x ¯ unstressed = 87.9 ± 25.3 nM, stressed = 63.4 ± 24.2 nM; 5HT, x ¯ unstressed = 2.38 + 1.02 nM, stressed = 0.781 ± 0.522 nM; TA, x ¯ unstressed = 14.4 ± 4.58 nM, stressed = 12.8 ± 4.07 nM. Error bars represent ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. Physical agitation is likely to be a good predictor of imminent attack in honeybees because brood predators and honey thieves such as the honey badger (Mellivora capensis) have been observed to use their accomplished digging skills to break into beehives []. To confirm that our shaking manipulation produced a physiological change, we used a different group of bees to measure changes in biogenic monoamine levels previously shown to be affected by shaking, spinning, or agitating []. We found that 60 s of shaking significantly reduced constitutive levels of octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin in honeybee hemolymph at a time point following shaking that corresponded to when the cognitive tests reported below were performed ( Figure 2 ).\n\n2 2 = 0.24, p = 0.889), suggesting that the observed effect of shaking is robust and does not depend on which positive and negative USs are experienced during conditioning. Furthermore, the reduction in likelihood of responses seen in the shaken bees did not reflect a general effect of stress on olfactory sensory processing or motivation to respond because shaken bees' responses to the CS+ were unaffected (least-squares contrast, χ 1 2 = 0.14, p = 0.706). Therefore, our data show that shaken bees alter their classification of ambiguous test odors and particularly the CS−. Figure 3 Shaken Honeybees Exhibit a Pessimistic Cognitive Bias Show full caption 1 2 = 8.08, p = 0.005). The bees were significantly less likely to respond to the CS− and its adjacent novel odor (∗p < 0.05). The data represent the pooled responses from all three unconditioned stimulus (US) treatments reported in control = 69, n shaken = 78; error bars represent ± 1 SEM. When honeybees were subjected to shaking and then tested with the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odors, the slope of the gradient of the line indicating the proportion of bees that extended their proboscis [i.e., P(response)] became steeper (shaking × test odor interaction: χ= 8.08, p = 0.005). The bees were significantly less likely to respond to the CS− and its adjacent novel odor (p < 0.05). The data represent the pooled responses from all three unconditioned stimulus (US) treatments reported in Figure S1 . n= 69, n= 78; error bars represent ± 1 SEM.

We observed that shaken bees exhibited pessimistic judgment biases. Within 5 min of the shaking manipulation, all of the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odor stimuli presented in a randomly chosen order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odors composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odor ( Figure 3 Table 1 ). This effect was independent of the pair of USs used (see Figure S1 available online; US × test odor × shaken interaction, logistic regression χ= 0.24, p = 0.889), suggesting that the observed effect of shaking is robust and does not depend on which positive and negative USs are experienced during conditioning. Furthermore, the reduction in likelihood of responses seen in the shaken bees did not reflect a general effect of stress on olfactory sensory processing or motivation to respond because shaken bees' responses to the CS+ were unaffected (least-squares contrast, χ= 0.14, p = 0.706). Therefore, our data show that shaken bees alter their classification of ambiguous test odors and particularly the CS−.\n\n25 Wright G.A.\n\nKottcamp S.M.\n\nThomson M.G.A.

An integrative and functional framework for the study of animal emotion and mood. Our study differs from previous cognitive bias studies in showing that the greatest effect of the negative manipulation is on the response to the CS−, as opposed to just the novel, ambiguous stimuli. We were able to measure a reduction in responding to the CS− because a percentage of our subjects still responded as if it signaled the CS+ after conditioning. The fact that some bees still extended the proboscis to the CS− indicates that our conditioning task was difficult for the bees to perform []. Furthermore, cognitive bias has previously only been studied in vertebrate animals where the subjects experienced many conditioning trials over several days, whereas our bees were tested 10 min after receiving only 12 conditioning trials. The cognitive bias we observed indicates that the shaken bees have an increased expectation of punishment (i.e., receiving the US associated with the CS−). This could reflect a change in either the bees' perception of the probability of punishment or the impact of punishment [].\n\n12 Brydges N.M.\n\nLeach M.\n\nNicol K.\n\nWright R.\n\nBateson M.

Previous research has established that honeybees, like vertebrates, possess the cognitive sophistication to generalize from one stimulus to another based on its consequences rather than its sensory properties []. Our data are the first to demonstrate that, as in human subjects, state alters a honeybee's judgments toward signals associated with potential threats to fitness. The physiological mechanisms that produce this change are poorly understood. In honeybees, octopamine is the local neurotransmitter that functions during reward learning [], whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odors with quinine punishment []. In insects, these monoamines are also constitutive hormones. Our data suggest that constitutive levels of octopamine, dopamine, or serotonin influence the way that the neural circuits involved in cognitive generalization function. In Drosophila, constitutive serotonin affects the expression of aggression in male flies. If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of constitutive serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently, indicating that the neural circuits involved in this behavior still function []. If the insect brain is organized such that the same neural circuits are involved in both reward learning and punishment [], fluctuations in hemolymph serotonin, octopamine, and dopamine caused by an acute stressor could affect the expression of olfactory memories by acting directly on the circuits encoding them and hence lead to the cognitive bias that we observe.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

While a variety of approaches have already been studied for this task, ranging from (relational versions of) probabilistic graphical models [@Richardson2006; @de2007problog] to neural-network architectures [@DBLP:conf/ilp/SourekMZSK16; @DBLP:conf/nips/Rocktaschel017] and graph-based methods [@lao2011random; @DBLP:conf/sigir/LiuJHLQ16], logic-based inference has several advantages over these other forms of inference. For example, logic-based inference is explainable: there is a proof for any derived statement, which can, in principle, be shown to a human user. It is also more transparent than most other methods, in the sense that a knowledge base as a whole can be understood and modified by domain experts. On the other hand, classic logical inference can be very brittle when some of the rules which are used are imperfect, or some of the initial facts may be incorrect. Statistical relational learning approaches, such as Markov logic networks [@Richardson2006] or probabilistic logic programming [@de2007problog], offer a solution to this latter problem, but they require learning a joint probability distribution over the set of possible worlds. This distribution is typically estimated from one or several large examples using maximum likelihood, which essentially corresponds to finding a maximum-entropy distribution given by a set of sufficient statistics. However, there are usually no guarantees on the learned distributions beyond guarantees for the sufficient statistics (see, e.g., [@kuzelka2018relational]), which means that we do not have much control over the quality of the predictions. Moreover, these models are not easy to modify, and are not always easy to explain because the way in which probabilities are computed can simply be too complex.\n\nIn this paper we focus on forms of inference that stay as close to classical logic as possible while not breaking completely when the given theory happens to be “mildly” inconsistent with the data. This problem of reasoning under inconsistency has a long tradition in the field of artificial intelligence, with common solutions including the use of paraconsistent logics [@da1974theory; @priest1979logic], belief revision [@Gardenfors] (and related inconsistency repair mechanisms [@konieczny2002merging]), and argumentation-based inference [@elvang1995argumentative; @amgoud2014postulates]. In contrast to these approaches, however, our specific aim is to study forms of inference that can allow us to bound the (expected) number of mistakes that are made. To this end, we introduce two inference relations called [*$k$-entailment*]{} and [*voting entailment*]{}, both of which are close to classical logic, and in particular do not require rules to be weighted. We define them such that errors produced by imperfect rules would not necessarily propagate too much in the given relational data.\n\nAs our main contribution, we are able to show that in a relational learning scenario from [@kuzelka2018relational], in which a (large) training example and a test example are sampled from a hidden relational structure, there are non-trivial PAC-type bounds on the number of errors that a theory learned on the training example produces on the test example. From this perspective, our work can also be seen as a relational-learning counterpart of PAC semantics [@valiant_knowledge_infusion].\n\n#### Technical contributions.\n\nThe results presented in this paper rest mainly on the following two technical contributions: (i) the introduction of bounds on the worst case behavior of the considered inference relations, and (ii) new concentration inequalities for sampling from relational data without replacement that allow us to bound the (expected) test error as a function of the training error, in the spirit of classical PAC-learning results [@valiant1984theory].\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n=============\n\nIn this paper we consider a function-free first-order logic language $\\mathcal{L}$, which is built from a set of constants $\\textit{Const}$, variables $\\textit{Var}$, and predicates $\\textit{Rel} = \\bigcup_i \\textit{Rel}_i$, where $\\textit{Rel}_i$ contains the predicates of arity $i$. We assume an untyped language. For $a_1,...,a_k \\in \\textit{Const}\\cup \\textit{Var}$ and $R \\in \\textit{Rel}_k$, we call $R(a_1,...,a_k)$ an atom. If $a_1,..,a_k\\in \\textit{Const}$, this atom is called ground. A literal is an atom or its negation. The formula $\\alpha_0$ is called a grounding of $\\alpha$ if $\\alpha_0$ can be obtained by replacing each variable in $\\alpha$ with a constant from $\\textit{Const}$. A formula is called closed if all variables are bound by a quantifier. A possible world $\\omega$ is defined as a set of ground atoms. The satisfaction relation $\\models$ is defined in the usual way. A substitution is a mapping from variables to terms.\n\nPROBLEM SETTING\n===============\n\nFirst we describe the learning setting considered in this paper. It follows the setting from [@kuzelka2018relational],which was used to study the estimation of relational marginals.\n\nAn example is a pair $(\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C})$, with $\\mathcal{C}$ a set of constants and $\\mathcal{A}$ a set of ground atoms which only use constants from $\\mathcal{C}$. An example is intended to provide a complete description of the world, hence any ground atom over $\\mathcal{C}$ which is not contained in $\\mathcal{A}$ is implicitly assumed to be false. Note that this is why we have to explicitly specify $\\mathcal{C}$, as opposed to simply considering the set of constants appearing in $\\mathcal{A}$. In practice, we usually only have partial information about some example of interest. The problems we consider in this paper relate to how we can then reason about the probability that a given ground atom is true (i.e. belongs to the example). To estimate such probabilities, we assume that we are given a fragment of the example, which we can use as training data. Specifically, let $\\Upsilon = (\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C})$ be an example and $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$. The fragment $\\Upsilon\\langle S \\rangle = (\\mathcal{B},\\mathcal{S})$ is defined as the restriction of $\\Upsilon$ to the constants in $\\mathcal{S}$, i.e. $\\mathcal{B}$ is the set of all atoms from $\\mathcal{A}$ which only contain constants from $\\mathcal{S}$. In a given example, any closed formula $\\alpha$ is either true or false. To assign probabilities to formulas in a meaningful way, we consider how often the formula is satisfied in small fragments of the given example.\n\n\\[def:probability\\_of\\_formula\\] Let $\\Upsilon = (\\mathcal{A},\\mathcal{C})$ be an example and $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$. For a closed formula $\\alpha$ without constants, we define its probability as follows[^1]: $$Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\alpha) = P_{\\mathcal{S} \\sim \\textit{Unif}({\\mathcal{C}},k)}\\left[ \\Upsilon\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle \\models \\alpha \\right]$$ where $\\textit{Unif}({\\mathcal{C}},k)$ denotes uniform distribution on size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}$.\n\nClearly $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{C}_k|} \\cdot \\sum_{\\mathcal{S} \\in {\\mathcal{C}}_k} \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle \\models \\alpha)$ where $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is the set of all size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}$.\n\nThe above definition is also extended straightforwardly to probabilities of sets of formulas (which we will also call [*theories*]{} interchangeably). If $\\Phi$ is a set of formulas, we set $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\Phi) = Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\bigwedge \\Phi)$ where $\\bigwedge \\Phi$ denotes the conjunction of all formulas in $\\Phi$.\n\nLet $\\textit{sm}/1$ be a unary predicate denoting that someone is a smoker, e.g. $\\textit{sm}(\\textit{alice})$ means that ${\\textit{alice}}$ is a smoker. Let us have an example $\\Upsilon = (\\{ \\textit{fr}(\\textit{alice}, \\textit{bob}), \\textit{sm}(\\textit{alice}), \\textit{sm}(\\textit{eve}) \\},\n    \\{\\textit{alice}, \\textit{bob}, \\textit{eve} \\}),$ and formulas $\\alpha = \\forall X : \\textit{sm}(X)$ and $\\beta = \\exists X,Y : \\textit{fr}(X,Y)$. Then, for instance, $Q_{\\Upsilon,1}(\\alpha) = 2/3$, $Q_{\\Upsilon,2}(\\alpha) = 1/3$ and $Q_{\\Upsilon,2}(\\beta) = 1/3$.\n\nA masking process is a function $\\kappa$ from examples to ground conjunctions that assigns to any $\\Upsilon = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$ a conjunction of ground literals $\\beta$ such that $\\Upsilon \\models \\beta$. We also define $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle$ to be the conjunction consisting of all literals from $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ that contain only constants from ${\\mathcal{S}}$.\n\nUnlike examples, masked examples only encode partial information about the world. This is why they are encoded using conjunctions of literals, so we can explicitly encode which atoms we know to be false.\n\nLet $\\Upsilon = \\{ \\textit{sm}(\\textit{alice}),$ $\\textit{fr}(\\textit{alice},\\textit{bob}),$ $\\{\\textit{alice},\\textit{bob}\\} \\}.$ Then a masking process $\\kappa$ may, for instance, yield $\\kappa(\\Upsilon) = \\neg \\textit{sm}(\\textit{bob}) \\wedge \\textit{sm}(alice)$. In this case $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ retains the information that $\\textit{alice}$ is a smoker and $\\textit{bob}$ is not, but it no longer contains any information about their friendship relation.\n\nNext we introduce the statistical setting considered in this paper.\n\n\\[def:inductive\\_setting\\] Let $\\aleph = ({\\mathcal{A}}_\\aleph, {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph)$ be an example and $\\kappa$ be a masking function. Let ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon \\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$ and ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma \\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$ be uniformly sampled subsets of size $n$ and $u$, respectively. We call $\\Upsilon = \\aleph \\langle {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon \\rangle$ the [*training example*]{} and $\\Gamma = \\aleph \\langle {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma \\rangle$ the [*test example*]{}. We assume that the learner receives $\\Upsilon$ in the training phase and $\\kappa(\\Gamma)$ in the test phase.\n\nWith slight abuse of terminology, we will sometimes say that $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Gamma$ are sampled from $\\aleph$.\n\nIn addition to the training example $\\Upsilon$ and masked test example $\\kappa(\\Gamma)$, we will assume that we are given a set of formulas $\\Phi$ (which we will also refer to as rules). Our main focus will be on how these formulas can be used to recover as much of $\\Gamma$ as possible. Rather than specifying a loss function that should be minimized, we want to find a form of inference which allows us to provide bounds on the (expected) number of incorrect literals that can be inferred from $\\{\\kappa(\\Gamma)\\} \\cup \\Phi$. Note that in this case, the training example $\\Upsilon$ is used to estimate the accuracy of the set of formulas. We also analyze the case where the rules are learned from the training example $\\Upsilon$ (in the spirit of classical PAC-learning results). Among others, the setting from Definition \\[def:inductive\\_setting\\] is close to how Markov logic networks are typically used. For instance, when training Markov logic networks, one typically starts with a training example that contains all facts (i.e. nothing is unknown about the training set), on which a model is trained. This model is then used to predict unknown facts about a test example. However, unlike for Markov logic networks, we do not attempt to learn a probability distribution. It was shown in [@kuvzelka2017induction] that models based on classic logical inference, like those considered in this paper, work well in practice for relational inference from evidence sets containing a [*small*]{} number of constants (domain elements). Thus, such models are also of considerable practical interest.\n\nREASONING WITH INACCURATE RULES\n===============================\n\nWhen reasoning with imperfect rules, using classical inference can have drastic consequences, as we will illustrate in Section \\[secClassicalErrors\\]. Even a single mistake can lead to many errors, since an incorrectly derived literal can be used as the basis for further inferences. This means that classical inference is not suitable for the considered setting, even in cases where the given rules have perfect accuracy on the training example. Intuitively, to allow for any meaningful bounds to be derived, we need to prevent arbitrarily long chains of inference. To this end, we propose and motivate the use of a restricted form of inference, called $k$-entailment, in Section \\[sec:k-entailment\\]. A further restriction on inferences, based on a form of voting, is subsequently discussed in Section \\[sec:voting-entailment\\]. In Section \\[sec:pac\\] we will then show which bounds can be derived for these two restricted forms of inference.\n\nWHEN CLASSICAL REASONING LEADS TO ERRORS {#secClassicalErrors}\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe next example, which is related to label propagation as studied e.g. in [@xiang2011understanding], shows that classic logical reasoning on the obtained relational sample may produce [*many*]{} mistakes even when all the available rules are very [*accurate*]{}.\n\n\\[ex:mistakes1\\] Let $k = 2$, $\\Gamma = \\{ \\{ \\textit{rare}(c_1) \\},$ $\\{c_1,$ $c_2,$ $\\dots,$ $c_{1000000} \\}$, and $\\alpha = \\forall X,Y : \\textit{rare}(X) \\Rightarrow \\textit{rare}(Y)$. While the rule does not intuitively make sense, its accuracy is actually very high $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\alpha) = 1- 999999/(0.5 \\cdot 1000000 \\cdot 999999) = 0.999998$. When we apply this rule with the evidence $\\textit{rare}(c_1)$, we derive $\\textit{rare}(c_2)$, $\\dots$, $\\textit{rare}(c_{1000000})$, all of which are incorrect (i.e. not included in $\\Gamma$).\n\nNote that in this paper, we are interested in worst-case behavior, in the sense that the masking process which is used may be seen as adversarial. The next example further illustrates how adversarial masking processes can lead to problems, even for rules with near-perfect accuracy.\n\n\\[example:mistakes2\\] Let $k = 2$, $\\Gamma = \\{ \\{ \\textit{rare}(c_1)$, $e(c_1,c_2)$, $e(c_2,c_3)$, $\\dots$, $e(c_{999999},c_{1000000})$ $ \\},$ $\\{c_1,$ $c_2,$ $\\dots,$ $c_{1000000} \\}$, and $\\alpha = \\forall{X,Y} : \\textit{rare}(X) \\wedge e(X,Y) \\Rightarrow \\textit{rare}(Y)$. In this case, there is only one size-$k$ subset of $C_\\Gamma$ where the formula $\\alpha$ does not hold, so the accuracy is even higher than in the previous example. Yet the adversarial masking process can select evidence consisting of all true positive literals from $\\Gamma$, i.e. the evidence will consist of the $\\textit{rare}(c_1)$ literal and all the $e/2$ literals from $\\Gamma$. Then the set of errors that are made when using the formula $\\alpha$ will be the same as in Example \\[ex:mistakes1\\], despite the fact that the rule is almost perfect on $\\Gamma$.\n\nNote that in the examples above, we had perfect knowledge of the accuracy of the rule $\\alpha$ on the test example (i.e. we knew the value of $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\alpha)$). In practice, this accuracy needs to be estimated from the training example. In such cases, it can thus happen that a rule $\\alpha$ has accuracy $1$ on the training example $\\Upsilon$, but still produces many errors on $\\kappa(\\Gamma)$. We will provide PAC-type bounds for this setting with estimated accuracies in Sections \\[sec:pac\\]. First, however, in Section \\[sec:k-entailment\\] and \\[sec:voting-entailment\\] we will look at how bounds can be provided on the number of incorrectly derived literals in the case where $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\alpha)$ is known. As the above examples illustrate, to obtain reasonable bounds, we will need to consider forms of inference which are weaker than classical entailment.\n\nBOUNDED REASONING USING $k$-ENTAILMENT {#sec:k-entailment}\n--------------------------------------\n\nWe saw that even for formulas which hold for almost all subsets of $\\Gamma$, the result of using them for inference can be quite disastrous. This was to a large extent due to the fact that we had inference chains involving a large number of domain elements (constants). This observation suggests a natural way to restrict the kinds of inferences that can be made when imperfect rules are involved.\n\nLet $k$ be a non-negative integer, $\\Upsilon = ({\\mathcal{A}}, {\\mathcal{C}})$ be an example, $\\kappa$ be a masking process, and $\\Phi$ be a set of closed formulas. We say that a ground formula $\\varphi$ is $k$-entailed by $\\Phi$ and $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$, denoted $\\{\\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\} \\cup \\Phi \\models_k \\varphi$, if there is a $\\mathcal{C}' \\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}$ such that $|\\mathcal{C}'| \\leq k$, $\\textit{const}(\\varphi) \\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}'$, $\\{\\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\langle \\mathcal{C}' \\rangle \\} \\cup \\Phi$ is consistent and $\\{ \\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\langle \\mathcal{C}' \\rangle \\} \\cup \\Phi \\models \\varphi$.\n\nIn other words, a formula $\\phi$ is $k$-entailed by $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Phi$ if it can be proved using $\\Phi$ together with a fragment of $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ induced by no more than $k$ constants, with the additional condition that $\\Phi$ and this fragment are not contradictory.\n\nLet $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\Upsilon &= (\\{ \\textit{fr}(\\textit{alice}, \\textit{bob}), \\textit{sm}(\\textit{alice}) \\}, \\{\\textit{alice}, \\textit{bob}, \\textit{eve} \\})\\\\\n    \\kappa(\\Upsilon) &= \\textit{fr}(\\textit{alice} \\wedge \\textit{bob}) \\wedge \\textit{sm}(\\textit{alice}) \\\\\n    \\Phi &= \\{ \\forall X,Y \\colon \\textit{fr}(X,Y) \\wedge \\textit{sm}(X) \\Rightarrow \\textit{sm}(Y) \\}.\\end{aligned}$$ Then $\\varphi = \\textit{sm}(bob)$ is $2$-entailed from $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ and $\\Phi$ but not $1$-entailed.\n\nNote that, in the setting of Example \\[example:mistakes2\\], $k$-entailment would make at most $k-1$ mistakes. However, $2$-entailment would already produce many mistakes in the case of Example \\[ex:mistakes1\\]. So there are cases where $k$-entailment produces fewer errors than classical logic entailment but, quite naturally, also cases where both produce the same number of errors. Importantly, however, for $k$-entailment, we can obtain non-trivial bounds on the number of errors.\n\nNext we state two lemmas that follow immediatelly from the respective definitions.\n\n\\[lemma:union\\] Let $\\Upsilon = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$ be an example, $\\Phi$ be a set of constant-free formulas and $\\kappa$ be a masking function. Let $\\mathcal{C}_k$ be the set of all size-$k$ subsets of $\\mathcal{C}$. Let $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ denote the set of all ground literals which can be derived using $k$-entailment from $\\{ \\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\} \\cup \\Phi$ and only contain constants from $\\mathcal{X}$. Then $\\mathcal{H}_\\mathcal{C} = \\bigcup_{\\mathcal{S} \\in {\\mathcal{C}}_l} \\mathcal{H}_\\mathcal{S}. $\n\n\\[remark:monotonicity\\] When $\\Gamma\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle \\models \\Phi$ then all ground literals that only contain constants from $\\mathcal{S}$ and that are entailed by $\\{\\kappa(\\Gamma\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle)\\} \\cup \\Phi$ must be true in $\\Gamma \\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle$.\n\nWe now provide a bound on the number of ground literals wrongly $k$-entailed by a given $\\Phi$, assuming that we know its accuracy $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)$ on the example $\\Gamma$.\n\n\\[prop:simplebound\\] Let $\\Gamma = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$ be an example, $\\Phi$ be a set of constant-free formulas and $\\kappa$ be a masking process. Next let $\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)$ be the set of all ground literals of a predicate $p/a$, $a\\leq k$, which are $k$-entailed by $\\{\\kappa(\\Gamma)\\} \\cup \\Phi$ but are false in $\\Gamma$. Then $$|\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq (1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^k k^a.$$\n\nFirst, we note that the number of size-$k$ subsets is bounded by $|{\\mathcal{C}}|^k$ and the number of different ground $p/a$ atoms in each of these subsets is $k^a$. It follows from Lemma \\[remark:monotonicity\\] and Lemma \\[lemma:union\\] that for any literal $\\delta \\in \\mathcal{F}$ there must be a size-$k$ set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\\Gamma\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\not\\models \\Phi$. The number of all such ${\\mathcal{S}}$’s that satisfy $\\Gamma\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\not\\models \\Phi$ is bounded by $(1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^k$. Hence, we have $|\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq (1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^k k^a.$\n\nWe can notice that when we increase the domain size $|{\\mathcal{C}}|$, keeping $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)$ fixed and non-zero, the bound eventually becomes vacuous for predicates whose arity $a$ is strictly smaller than $k$. This is because the number of all ground literals grows only as $|{\\mathcal{C}}|^a$ whereas the bound grows as $|{\\mathcal{C}}|^k$. However, if $a=k$, the bound stays fixed when we increase the domain size. We will come back to consequences of this fact in Section \\[sec:results\\].\n\nBOUNDED REASONING USING VOTING {#sec:voting-entailment}\n------------------------------\n\nTo further restrict the set of entailed ground literals, we next introduce [*voting entailment*]{}.\n\nLet $k$ be an integer and $\\gamma \\in [0;1]$. Let $\\Upsilon = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$ be an example, $\\Phi$ be a set of constant-free formulas, and $\\kappa$ be a masking process. A ground literal $l$ of arity $a$, $a\\leq k$, is said to be entailed from $\\Phi$ and $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ by voting with parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ if there are at least $\\max\\{1,\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a}\\}$ size-$k$ sets ${\\mathcal{S}}\\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}$ such that $l$ is $k$-entailed by $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle$.\n\nThe next example illustrates the use of voting entailment.\n\nLet $\\Upsilon = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$, where ${\\mathcal{C}}= \\{\\textit{alice},\\textit{bob},\\textit{eve}\\}$, and let $\\kappa(\\Upsilon) = \\textit{fr}(\\textit{alice},\\textit{bob})$ $\\wedge$ $\\textit{fr}(\\textit{eve},\\textit{bob})$ $\\wedge$ $\\textit{sm}(\\textit{eve})$. Next, let $\\Phi = \\{ \\forall X,Y : \\textit{fr}(X,Y) \\wedge \\textit{sm}(X) \\Rightarrow \\textit{sm}(Y) \\}$. Then $\\textit{sm}(\\textit{bob})$ is entailed from $\\Phi$ and $\\kappa(\\Upsilon)$ by voting with the parameters $k = 2$ and $\\gamma = 2/3$, as $\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} = 2/3 \\cdot 3^{2-1} = 2$ and there are two size-$2$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}$ that $2$-entail $\\textit{sm}(\\textit{bob})$.\n\nWe now show how the bound from Proposition \\[prop:simplebound\\] can be strengthened in the case of voting entailment.\n\n\\[prop:voting\\] Let $k$ be an integer and $\\gamma \\in [0;1]$. Let $\\Gamma = ({\\mathcal{A}},{\\mathcal{C}})$ be an example, $\\Phi$ be a set of constant-free formulas, and $\\kappa$ be a masking process. Let $\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)$ be the set of all ground literals of a predicate $p/a$, $a\\leq k$, that are entailed by voting from $\\{\\kappa(\\Gamma)\\} \\cup \\Phi$ with parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ but are false in $\\Gamma$. If $\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} \\geq 1$ then $$\\begin{aligned}\n    |\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq \\left( 1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi) \\right) \\frac{|{\\mathcal{C}}|^{a} k^a}{\\gamma}\\end{aligned}$$ and otherwise $$\\begin{aligned}\n    |\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq \\left( 1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi) \\right) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k} k^a.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFirst we define the number of “votes” for a ground literal $l$ as $$\\#_{\\kappa(\\Gamma),\\Phi}(l) = |\\left\\{{\\mathcal{S}}\\subseteq {\\mathcal{C}}\\left| |{\\mathcal{S}}| {=} k, \\{\\kappa(\\Gamma)\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle\\} \\cup \\Phi \\models_k l \\right. \\right\\}|.$$ Let $L$ be the set of all ground $p/a$ literals $l$ such that $\\Gamma \\models \\neg l$. Then, since any size-$k$ subset of ${\\mathcal{C}}$ can only contribute $k^a$ votes to literals based on the predicate $p/a$, we have $$\\sum_{l \\in L} \\#_{\\kappa(\\Gamma),\\Phi}(l) \\leq \\left(1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi) \\right) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^k k^a.$$ Hence $|\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq \\frac{\\left( 1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi) \\right) |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k} k^a}{\\max\\{1, \\gamma\\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} \\}}. $ If $\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} \\geq 1$ then $|\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma)| \\leq \\left( 1-Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi) \\right) \\frac{|{\\mathcal{C}}|^{a} k^a}{\\gamma}$. The case when $\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} < 1$ follows from Theorem \\[prop:simplebound\\].\n\nUnlike for $k$-entailment, the fraction of “wrong” ground $p/a$ literals entailed by voting entailment does not grow with an increasing domain size as long as $\\gamma \\cdot |{\\mathcal{C}}|^{k-a} \\geq 1$.\n\nPROBABILISTIC BOUNDS {#sec:pac}\n====================\n\nWe now turn to the setting where the accuracy of the formulas needs to be estimated from a training example $\\Upsilon$. More generally, we also cover the case where the formulas themselves are learned from the training example. In such cases, to account for over-fitting, we need to consider the (size of the) hypothesis class that was used for learning these formulas. Specifically, we prove probabilistic bounds for variants of the following learning problem. We are given a hypothesis set $\\mathcal{H}$ of constant-free theories, and we want to compute bounds on the number of incorrectly predicted literals which simultaneously hold for all $\\Phi \\in \\mathcal{H}$ (as a function of $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\Phi)$) with probability at least $1-\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a confidence parameter. Note that the case where the theory $\\Phi$ is given, rather than learned, corresponds to $\\mathcal{H}=\\{\\Phi\\}$.\n\nWe start by proving general concentration inequalities in Section \\[sec:concentration\\] which we then use to prove bounds for $k$-entailment. These bounds are studied for the realizable case in Section \\[sec:realizable\\] and for the general case in Section \\[sec:non-zero\\]. Bounds for voting entailment are studied in Section \\[sec:voting-bounds\\]\n\nCONCENTRATION INEQUALITIES {#sec:concentration}\n--------------------------\n\nWe will need to bound the difference between the “accuracy” of given sets of logic formulas $\\Phi$ on the training sample $\\Upsilon$ and their accuracy on a test sample $\\Gamma$ (i.e. the difference between $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\Phi)$ and $Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\Phi)$). To prove the concentration inequalities in this section, we will utilize the following lemma.\n\n\\[lemma:crazy1\\] Let $\\aleph = ({\\mathcal{A}}_\\aleph, {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph)$ be an example. Let $0 \\leq n \\leq |{\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph|$ and $0 \\leq k \\leq n$ be integers. Let $\\mathbf{X} = ({\\mathcal{S}}_1,{\\mathcal{S}}_2,\\dots,{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor})$ be a vector of subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$, each sampled uniformly and independently of the others from all size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$. Next let $\\mathcal{C}_\\Upsilon$ be sampled uniformly from all size-$n$ subsets of $\\mathcal{C}_\\aleph$. Finally, let $\\mathcal{I}' = \\{ 1,2,\\dots,|{\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph| \\}$ and let $\\mathbf{Y} = ({\\mathcal{S}}_1',{\\mathcal{S}}_2',\\dots,{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor}')$ be a vector sampled by the following process:\n\n1.  Sample subsets $\\mathcal{I}_1',\\dots,\\mathcal{I}_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor}'$ of size $k$ from $\\mathcal{I}'$.\n\n2.  Sample an injective function $g : \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\mathcal{I}_i' \\rightarrow {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$ uniformly from all such functions.\n\n3.  Define ${\\mathcal{S}}_i' = g(\\mathcal{I}_i')$ for all $0 \\leq i \\leq \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$.\n\nThen $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ have the same distribution.\n\nThe next example illustrates the intuition behind the proof of this lemma, which can be found in [@kuzelka2018relational].\n\nLet ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph = \\{1,2,\\dots, 10^6\\}$. Let us sample $\\lfloor m/k \\rfloor$ size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$ uniformly. If this was the process that generates the data from which we estimate parameters, we could readily apply Hoeffding’s inequality to get the confidence bounds. However, in typical SRL settings (e.g. with MLNs), we are given a complete example on some set of constants (objects), rather than a set of small sampled fragments. So we instead need to assume that the whole training example is sampled at once, uniformly from all size-$m$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$. However, when we then estimate the probabilities of formulas from this example, we cannot use Hoeffding’s bound or any other bound expecting independent samples. What we can do[^2] is to mimic sampling from ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$ by sampling from an auxiliary set of constants of the same size as ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$ and then specialising these constants to constants from a sampled size-$m$ subset. Hence the first $\\lfloor m/k \\rfloor$ sampled sets will be distributed exactly as the first $\\lfloor m/k \\rfloor$ subsets sampled i.i.d. directly from ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph$.\n\nLemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\] was used in [@kuzelka2018relational] to prove a bound on expected error. Here we extend that result and use Lemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\] to prove the concentration inequalities stated in the next two theorems.\n\n\\[prop:u-concentration\\] Let $\\aleph = ({\\mathcal{A}}_\\aleph, {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph)$ be an example and let $0 \\leq n \\leq |{\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph|$ and $0 \\leq k \\leq n$ be integers. Let $\\mathcal{C}_\\Upsilon$ be sampled uniformly from all size-$n$ subsets of $\\mathcal{C}_\\aleph$ and let $\\Upsilon = \\aleph\\langle {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon \\rangle$. Let $\\alpha$ be a closed and constant-free formula and let ${\\mathcal{C}}_k$ denote all size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$. Let $\\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon = Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\alpha)$ and let $A_{\\aleph} = Q_{\\aleph,k}(\\alpha)$. Then we have $P[ \\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon - A_\\aleph \\geq \\varepsilon ] \\leq \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right)$, $P[ A_\\aleph-\\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon  \\geq \\varepsilon ] \\leq \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right)$, and $P\\left[ \\left| \\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon - A_\\aleph \\right| \\geq \\varepsilon \\right] \\leq 2 \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right).$\n\nFirst we define an auxiliary estimator $\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon}$. Let $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ be a vector of $\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor \\cdot q$ size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$ where the subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\Upsilon}$ in each of the $q$ non-overlapping size-$\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor$ segments $\\mathbf{Y}_1^{(q)}, \\mathbf{Y}_2^{(q)},\\dots,\\mathbf{Y}_q^{(q)}$ of $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ are sampled in the same way as the elements of the vector $\\mathbf{Y}$ in Lemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\], all with the same ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$ (i.e. $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ is the concatenation of the vectors $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_1,\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_2,\\dots,\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_q$). Let us define $\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} = \\frac{1}{q \\cdot \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha). $ We can rewrite $\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon}$ as $\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} =   \\frac{1}{q} \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}_{i}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha)$.\n\nThen we can use the following trick (Hoeffding [@hoeffding1963probability], Section 5) based on application of Jensen’s inequality and Markov’s inequality: If $T = a_1 \\cdot T_1 + a_2 \\cdot T_2 + \\dots + a_q \\cdot T_n$, where $a_i \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^q a_i = 1$, then, for any $h > 0$, $P[T \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\cdot {\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp{\\left( h (T_i - \\varepsilon) \\right)} \\right]}$. Note that the $T_i$’s do not have to be independent. Next, using Hoeffding’s lemma (Lemma 1 in [@hoeffding1963probability]), if $a_i = 1/q$ and each of the terms $T_i$ is a sum of independent random zero-mean variables $X_{j}^{(i)}$ such that $P[a \\leq X_{j}^{(i)} \\leq b]=1$ and $b-a \\leq 1$, then we get: $$\\begin{gathered}\nP[T \\geq \\varepsilon] \\le \\sum_{i=1}^q \\frac{1}{q} \\cdot {\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp{\\left( h (T_i - \\varepsilon) \\right)} \\right]} \\\\\n \\le e^{-h\\varepsilon} \\exp\\left(\\frac{m \\cdot h^2}{8} \\right) =  \\exp\\left(-h\\varepsilon + \\frac{m \\cdot h^2  }{8} \\right)\\end{gathered}$$ where $m$ denotes the number of summands of $T_i$ (which, in our case, is the same for all $T_i$’s). Note that this function achieves its minimum at $h = \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{m}.$ We set $T_i :=  \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}_{i}^{(q)}} \\left( \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha) - A_\\aleph \\right)$ (note that ${\\mathbb{E}\\left[ T_i \\right]} = 0$ and $m = \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor$). Thus, we get $P[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot ( \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} - A_\\aleph ) \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq \\exp\\left(-2  \\varepsilon^2 / \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\right),$ and finally $$P[\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} - A_\\aleph \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right),$$ symmetrically also $P\\left[A_\\aleph - \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} \\geq \\varepsilon \\right] \\leq \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right)$, and, using union bound, we get $$P[|\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} - A_\\aleph| \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq 2 \\exp\\left(-2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon^2 \\right).$$ It follows from the strong law of large numbers (which holds for any $\\Upsilon$) that $P[\\lim_{q \\rightarrow \\infty}\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} = \\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon] = 1$. Since $q$ was arbitrary, the statement of the proposition follows.\n\nAs the next theorem shows, the above result can be generalized to the case where we need to bound the difference between the estimations obtained from two samples.\n\n\\[prop:two-sample\\] Let $\\aleph = ({\\mathcal{A}}_\\aleph, {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph)$ be an example and let $0 \\leq n,u \\leq |{\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph|$ and $0 \\leq k \\leq n$ be integers. Let $\\mathcal{C}_\\Upsilon$ and $\\mathcal{C}_\\Gamma$ be sampled uniformly from all size-$n$ and size-$u$ subsets of $\\mathcal{C}_\\aleph$ and let $\\Upsilon = \\aleph\\langle {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon \\rangle, \\Gamma = \\aleph\\langle {\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma \\rangle$.

Let $\\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon = Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\alpha)$, $\\widehat{A}_\\Gamma = Q_{\\Gamma,k}(\\alpha)$, and let $A_{\\aleph} = Q_{\\aleph,k}(\\alpha)$.

Since we can also take negations of formulas, this theorem will be useful to prove bounds for formulas that are perfectly accurate on training data. As the following theorem shows, in this case we obtain stronger guarantees, where we have $\\varepsilon$ instead of $\\varepsilon^2$ in the exponential.\n\n\\[thm:realizable\\] Let $\\aleph = ({\\mathcal{A}}_\\aleph, {\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph)$ be an example and let $0 \\leq n \\leq |{\\mathcal{C}}_\\aleph|$ and $0 \\leq k \\leq n$ be integers.

Let $\\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon = Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\alpha)$ and let $A_{\\aleph} = Q_{\\aleph,k}(\\alpha) \\geq \\varepsilon.$ Then we have $$P\\left[\\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon = 0 \\right] \\leq\\exp\\left(- \\left\\lfloor n/k \\right\\rfloor \\varepsilon \\right).$$\n\nLet $\\mathbf{Y}$ be sampled as in Lemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\] (i.e. $\\mathbf{Y}$ is sampled only using $\\Upsilon$ and not directly $\\aleph$). Then using Lemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\] we know that the elements of $\\mathbf{Y}$ are distributed like $\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor$ independent samples (size-$k$ subsets) from $C_\\aleph$. Hence we can bound the probability $P[A_\\Upsilon = 0 ] \\leq (1-\\varepsilon)^{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\leq \\exp{\\left( - \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor \\varepsilon \\right)}$. Obviously, adding the rest of the information from size-$k$ subsets of $C_\\Upsilon$ that are not contained in $\\mathbf{Y}$ cannot increase the bound.\n\nZERO TRAINING ERROR CASE {#sec:realizable}\n------------------------\n\nWe start by proving a bound for the realizable (i.e. zero training error) case.\n\n\\[thm:realizable-expected\\] Let $\\aleph$, $\\Upsilon$, $\\Gamma$, $n$, $u$ and $\\kappa$ be as in Definition \\[def:inductive\\_setting\\] (i.e. $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Gamma$ are sampled from $\\aleph$ and $n, u$ are sizes of $\\Upsilon$’s and $\\Gamma$’s domains). Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a finite hypothesis class of constant-free formulas. Let $\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma,\\Phi)$ denote the set of all ground literals of a predicate $p/a$ that are $k$-entailed by $\\{\\kappa(\\Gamma)\\} \\cup \\Phi$ but are false in $\\Gamma$.[^4] With probability at least $1-\\delta$, the following holds for all $\\Phi \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that satisfy $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\Phi) = 1$: $${\\mathbb{E}\\left[ |\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma,\\Phi)| \\right]} \\leq \\frac{\\ln{|\\mathcal{H}|}+\\ln{1/\\delta}}{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} u^k k^a.$$\n\nIt follows from the linearity of expectation and from Proposition \\[prop:simplebound\\] that, for any $\\Phi$, ${\\mathbb{E}\\left[ |\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma,\\Phi)| \\right]} \\leq (1-Q_{\\aleph,k}(\\Phi)) u^k k^a.$ Next, it follows from Theorem \\[thm:realizable\\] and from the union bound taken over all $\\Phi \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that the probability that there exists $\\Phi \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $Q_{\\Upsilon,k}(\\Phi) = 1$ and $\\varepsilon \\leq 1-Q_{\\aleph,k}(\\Phi)$ is at most $|\\mathcal{H}| \\cdot \\exp{\\left( - \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor \\varepsilon \\right)}$.

The next theorem is different in that it provides a bound on the actual number of errors.\n\n\\[thm:epsilon-delta\\] Let $\\aleph$, $\\Upsilon$, $\\Gamma$, and $\\kappa$ be as in Definition \\[def:inductive\\_setting\\] (i.e. $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Gamma$ are sampled from $\\aleph$ and $n, u$ are sizes of $\\Upsilon$’s and $\\Gamma$’s domains).

The validity of the theorem then follows from the above and from Proposition \\[prop:simplebound\\] and the fact that $\\frac{ab}{a+b} \\geq \\frac{\\min(a,b)}{2}$ for any nonnegative $a$ and $b$.\n\nBOUNDS FOR VOTING ENTAILMENT {#sec:voting-bounds}\n----------------------------\n\nNext we prove a bound for voting entailment, which, unsurprisingly, is tighter than the respective bound for $k$-entailment.\n\n\\[thm:voting\\] Let $k$ be an integer and $\\gamma \\in [0;1]$.

Here, bounds are considered vacuous if they are not lower than the total number of ground literals. We first focus on $k$-entailment in Sections \\[sec61\\]–\\[sec63\\], and then discuss the results for voting entailment in Section \\[sec64\\]. Finally, we also make a connection to MAP-entailment in Section \\[secMAP\\].\n\nSMALL TEST EXAMPLES {#sec61}\n-------------------\n\nOne case where we have non-vacuous bounds for the [*expected*]{} number of incorrectly predicted literals with $k$-entailment is when the domain of the test examples $\\Gamma$ is small. Naturally a necessary condition is also that the given (or learned) theory $\\Phi$ is sufficiently accurate. The only way to be confident that $\\Phi$ is indeed sufficiently accurate, given that this accuracy needs to be estimated, is by estimating it on a sufficiently large training example. This is essentially what Theorems \\[thm:realizable-expected\\] and \\[thm:expected\\] imply.\n\nInterestingly, this finding agrees with some experimental observations in the literature. For instance, it has been observed in [@kuvzelka2017induction] that classical reasoning in a relational setting close to ours worked well for small-size test-set evidence but was not competitive with other methods for larger evidence sizes. The analysis in the present paper thus sheds light on experimental observations like these.\n\nNote that the bounds from Theorems \\[thm:realizable-expected\\] and \\[thm:expected\\] are for the [*expected*]{} value of the number of errors. Bounds on the actual number of errors are provided in Theorem \\[thm:epsilon-delta\\]. In this case, to obtain non-vacuous bounds, we also need to require that the domain of the test example $\\Gamma$ be sufficiently large. This is not unexpected, however, as it is a known property of statistical bounds for transductive settings (see e.g., [@tolstikhin2016minimax]) that the size of the test set affects confidence bounds, similarly to how the size of the $\\Gamma$’s domain affects the bound in Theorem \\[thm:epsilon-delta\\].\n\nPREDICATES OF ARITY K {#sec62}\n---------------------\n\nAnother case where we have non-vacuous bounds for $k$-entailment is when the arity of the predicted literals is equal to the parameter $k$. In this case both the bounds for the expected error and for the actual error $|\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma,\\Phi)|$ are non-vacuous. This means that our results cover important special cases. One such special case is classical attribute-value learning when $k = 1$ and we represent attributes by unary predicates. Another case is link prediction when $k = 2$ and higher-arity versions thereof. In link prediction, we have rules such as, for instance, $\\forall X,Y : \\textit{CoensFan}(X) \\wedge \\textit{CoensFilm}(Y) \\Rightarrow \\textit{likes}(X,Y).$\n\nREALIZABLE SETTING {#sec63}\n------------------\n\nWe can get stronger guarantees when the given (or learned) theory $\\Phi$ has zero training error. Keeping the fraction of the domain-sizes $|{\\mathcal{C}}_{\\Gamma}|^{k-a}/|{\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon|$ small, Theorem \\[thm:realizable-expected\\] implies non-vacuous bounds for predicates of arity $a$ for any size of the domain of $\\Gamma$. Intuitively, this means that we can use theories that are completely accurate on training data for inference using $k$-entailment. However, the required size of the domain of the training example $\\Upsilon$, to guarantee that we will not produce too many errors, grows exponentially with $k$ (for a fixed arity $a$) and polynomially with $|{\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma|$.\n\nVOTING {#sec64}\n------\n\nWhen using voting entailment, we can always obtain non-trivial bounds by making $\\gamma$ large; obviously this comes at the price of making the inferences more cautious. Voting entailment is a natural inference method in domains where one proof is not enough, i.e. where the support from several proofs is needed before we can be sufficiently confident in the conclusion; an example of such a domain is the well-known [*smokers*]{} domain, where knowing that one friend smokes does not provide enough evidence to conclude that somebody smokes; only if we have evidence of several smoker friends is the conclusion warranted that this person smokes.\n\nRELATIONSHIP TO MAP INFERENCE {#secMAP}\n-----------------------------\n\nA popular approach to collective classification in relational domains is MAP-inference in Markov logic networks. Therefore a natural question is how this approach performs in our setting. Perhaps surprisingly, it might produce as many errors as classical logic reasoning in the examples from Section \\[secClassicalErrors\\], if the Markov logic network contains the same rules, all with positive weights, as we had in these examples. This is because MAP-inference will predict the same literals as classical logical inference when the rules from the Markov logic network are consistent with the given evidence. Thus, we can see that our guarantees for both $k$-entailment and voting entailment are better than guarantees one could get for MAP-inference. This is also in agreement with the well-known observations that, for instance, in the smokers domain, MAP inference often predicts everyone to be a smoker or everyone to be a non-smoker if there is only a small amount of evidence.\n\nRELATED WORK\n============\n\nOur main inspiration comes from the works on PAC-semantics by Valiant [@valiant_knowledge_infusion] and Juba [@juba]. Our work differs mainly in the fact that we have one large relational structure $\\aleph$, and a training example $\\Upsilon$ and a test example $\\Gamma$, both sampled from $\\aleph$, whereas it is assumed in these existing approaches that learning examples are sampled i.i.d. from some distribution. This has two important consequences. First, they could use statistical techniques developed for i.i.d. data whereas we had to first derive concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement in the relational setting. Second, since they only needed to bound the error on the independently sampled examples, they did not have to consider the number of incorrectly inferred facts. In contrast, in the relational setting that we considered here, the number of errors made on one relational example is the quantity that needs to be bounded. It follows that completely different techniques are needed in our case. Another difference is that, in their case, the training examples are also masked. In principle, we could modify our results to accommodate for masked examples by replacing “accurate” formulas by sufficiently-often “witnessed” formulas (see [@juba] for a definition).\n\nDhurandhar and Dobra [@dhurandhar2012distribution] derived Hoeffding-type inequalities for classifiers trained with relational data, but these inequalities, which are based on the restriction on the independent interactions of data points, cannot be applied to solve the problems considered in the present paper. Certain other statistical properties of learning have also been studied for SRL models. For instance, Xiang and Neville [@xiang2011relational] studied consistency of estimation. However, guaranteeing convergence to the correct distribution does not mean that the model would not generate many errors when used, e.g., for MAP-inference. In [@xiang2011understanding], they further studied errors in label propagation in collective classification. In their setting, however, the relational graph is fixed and one only predicts labels of vertices exploiting the relational structure for making the predictions. Here we also note that it is not always possible or desirable in practice to sample sets of domain elements uniformly as we assumed to be the case in our analysis. Other sampling designs for relational data were studied, e.g. in [@ahmed2012network]. A study of PAC guarantees for such other sampling designs is left as a topic for future work.\n\nThere have also been works studying restricted forms of inference in a purely logical context, e.g. [@d2013semantics]. It is an interesting question for future work to find out which existing restricted inference systems would lead to non-vacuous error bounds in the relational setting.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n===========\n\nWe have studied the problem of predicting plausible missing facts in relational data, given a set of imperfect logical rules, in a PAC reasoning setting. As for the considered inference methods, one of our main objectives was for the inference methods to stay close to classical logic. The first inference method, $k$-entailment, is a restricted form of classical logic inference and hence satisfies this objective. The second inference method, voting entailment, is based on a form of voting that combines results from inferences made by $k$-entailment on subsets of the relational data. Importantly, the voting is not weighted which makes voting entailment easier to understand. We were able to obtain non-trivial bounds for the number of literals incorrectly predicted by a learned (or given) theory for both $k$-entailment and voting entailment. Probably the most useful results of our analysis lie in the identification of cases where the bounds for learning and reasoning in relational data are non-vacuous, which we discussed in detail in Section \\[sec:results\\].\n\nThere are many interesting directions in which one could extend the results presented in this paper. For instance, as practical means to improve the explainability of inferences made by voting entailment, we could first find representatives of isomorphism classes of “proofs” that are aggregated by voting entailment, and only show these to the user. Another direction is to extend the notion of implicit learning from [@juba] into the relational setting. It would also be interesting to exploit explicit sparsity constraints and to study other sampling designs, although that might also turn out to be analytically less tractable than the setting considered in the present paper. Finally, although all bounds presented in this paper assume finite hypothesis classes, we note that it is also possible to extend our results to infinite hypothesis classes [@kuzelka2018ecmlpkdd].\n\n[**Acknowledgments**]{}\n\nOK’s work was partially supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders (project G.0428.15).

Let $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ be a vector of $\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor \\cdot q$ size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$ where the subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\Upsilon}$ in each of the $q$ non-overlapping size-$\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor$ segments $\\mathbf{Y}_1^{(q)}, \\mathbf{Y}_2^{(q)},\\dots,\\mathbf{Y}_q^{(q)}$ of $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ are sampled in the same way as the elements of the vector $\\mathbf{Y}$ in Lemma \\[lemma:crazy1\\], all with the same ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Upsilon$ (i.e. $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$ is the concatenation of the vectors $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_1,\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_2,\\dots,\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}_q$). Another vector $\\mathbf{Z}^{(q)}$ which contains $\\lfloor u/k\\rfloor\\cdot q$ size-$k$ subsets of ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\Gamma}$ is sampled in the same way. Note that $\\mathbf{Z}^{(q)}$ is independent of $\\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}$. Let us define $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} &= \\frac{1}{q \\cdot \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha) \\text{ and,}\\\\ \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} &=   \\frac{1}{q \\cdot \\lfloor u/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Z}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Gamma\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha).\\end{aligned}$$ We can rewrite them as $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} =  \\frac{1}{q} \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}_{i}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha),\\\\\n    \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} =   \\frac{1}{q} \\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\frac{1}{\\lfloor u/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Z}_{i}^{(q)}} \\mathds{1}(\\Gamma\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha).\\end{aligned}$$ Let us denote $m_1 = \\lfloor n/k \\rfloor$, $m_2 = \\lfloor u/k \\rfloor$ and $T_i := \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Y}_{i}^{(q)}} \\left( \\mathds{1}(\\Upsilon\\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha) - A_\\aleph \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\lfloor u/k \\rfloor} \\sum_{{\\mathcal{S}}\\in \\mathbf{Z}_{i}^{(q)}} \\left( \\mathds{1}(\\Gamma \\langle {\\mathcal{S}}\\rangle \\models \\alpha) - A_\\aleph \\right)$ (we note that ${\\mathbb{E}\\left[ T_i \\right]} = 0$). Using the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem \\[prop:u-concentration\\], we obtain the following: $$\\begin{aligned}\nP[\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} &-& \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} \\geq \\varepsilon] \\\\\n&\\le& \\sum_{i=1}^q \\frac{1}{q} \\cdot {\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp{\\left( h (T_i - \\varepsilon) \\right)} \\right]} \\\\\n &\\le & e^{-h\\varepsilon} \\exp\\left(\\frac{  h^2}{8m_1} \\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{  h^2}{8m_2} \\right) \\\\\n& = & \\exp\\left(-h\\varepsilon + \\frac{m_1+m_2   }{8 m_1 m_2}\\cdot h^2 \\right)\\end{aligned}$$ The bound achieves its minimum at $h = \\frac{4\\varepsilon m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}.$\n\nThus, we get $$P[\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} - \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{-2\\varepsilon^2}{1/\\lfloor n/k\\rfloor+1/\\lfloor u/k\\rfloor} \\right),$$ symmetrically also $P[\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} - \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} \\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq \\exp\\left(\\frac{-2\\varepsilon^2}{1/\\lfloor n/k\\rfloor+1/\\lfloor u/k\\rfloor} \\right)$, and, using union bound, we get $$P[|\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} - \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} |\\geq \\varepsilon] \\leq 2\\exp\\left(\\frac{-2\\varepsilon^2}{1/\\lfloor n/k\\rfloor+1/\\lfloor u/k\\rfloor} \\right).$$ It follows from the strong law of large numbers (which holds for any $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Gamma$) that $P[\\lim_{q \\rightarrow \\infty}\\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Upsilon} = \\widehat{A}_\\Upsilon \\hbox{ and } \\widetilde{A}^{(q)}_{\\Gamma} = \\widehat{A}_\\Gamma] = 1$. Since $q$ was arbitrary, the statement of the proposition follows.\n\nREPRESENTING CONSTANTS USING AUXILIARY PREDICATES\n=================================================\n\nIn this paper we restricted ourselves to reasoning with theories that do not contain any constants. It is straightforward to extend our results to provide PAC-type bounds also for theories with constants by introducing auxiliary predicates. For instance, in the smokers domain, if we want to express that friends of Alice do not smoke, i.e. $\\forall X : \\textit{fr}(alice,X) \\Rightarrow \\neg \\textit{sm}(X)$, then we may introduce an auxiliary predicate $\\textit{friendOfAlice}/1$ and the rule becomes $\\forall X : \\textit{friendOfAlice}(X) \\Rightarrow \\neg \\textit{sm}(X)$. We note here that it is not necessary to add auxiliary predicates explicitly in practice. We use auxiliary predicates just for theoretical purposes to explain how the results about PAC-reasoning derived in this paper can be applied when constants are allowed.\n\nThis also reveals interesting properties of the problem. For instance, in order to do non-trivial reasoning based on $k$-entailment with a theory consisting only of the rule $$\\forall X,Y: \\textit{sm}(X) \\wedge \\textit{fr}(X,Y) \\Rightarrow \\textit{sm}(Y)$$ we need $k \\geq 2$. However, for the rule $$\\forall X : \\textit{friendOfAlice}(X) \\Rightarrow \\neg \\textit{sm}(X)$$ we only need $k \\geq 1$. Hence, for the derived PAC bounds, we can see that the expected number of errors made when using only the second rule grows as in the attribute-value case whereas the expected number of errors for the first rule may grow more quickly with the increasing size of the test examples (cf. Theorem \\[thm:expected\\]).\n\n[^1]: We will use $Q$ for probabilities of formulas as defined in this section, to avoid confusion with other “probabilities” we deal with in the text.\n\n[^2]: Note that we do not need to do this in practice which will follow from Theorem \\[prop:u-concentration\\]; we only need this mimicking process to prove that theorem.\n\n[^3]: This is essentially due to the fact that we use Hoeffding’s decomposition whereas Lovasz relies on Azuma’s inequality, leading to a looser bound compared to our bound.\n\n[^4]: Note that here, as well as in the rest of the theorems in the paper, $\\mathcal{F}(\\Gamma,\\Phi)$ is a set-valued random variable.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "(1) Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a home security system that monitors the inside of a facility, and especially relates to a home security system that detects any occurrence of alarming situations and captures the images within a house or a facility by a camera.\n(2) Description of the Related Art\nSo far, a home security system for monitoring the inside of a house has been proposed (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. H10-271572 as reference).\nThe conventional home security system mentioned above includes a plurality of sensors that detect any intruder breaking in, a plurality of cameras that are installed within a house, and a control unit that controls the cameras according to the result of detection by the sensors.\nFor example, when one of the aforementioned sensors detects an intruder breaking in, the control unit makes a camera that is fixedly associated with the sensor to capture the image, and sends the captured image data to an external home care service center via communication lines.\nHowever, in the conventional home security system, each of the sensors and cameras are always associated with each other according to certain relationships, and the locations for capturing images cannot be varied nor the number be increased or decreased according to the level and condition of monitoring.\nFor instance, when the conventional home security system is installed in a house, and a sensor that detects an intruder breaking in from an entrance hall and a camera that captures the image of the entrance hall area are fixedly associated with each other, then when the sensor detects an intruder breaking in, the control unit chooses, among a plurality of cameras, the camera that is associated with the sensor to be the only camera to capture the image. As a result, even when the user, meaning the resident of the house, desires to have sufficient monitoring for going out, only one camera that is fixedly associated with a certain sensor captures images in the conventional home security system, and cannot make other cameras capture images. On the other hand, even when the user is at home and feeling a light monitoring is sufficient, in the conventional home security system, all the cameras that are fixedly associated with a certain sensor are going to capture images.\nNow, in consideration of the foregoing problems, the object of the present invention is to provide a home security system that allows to vary as well as increase and decrease the locations of capturing images according to the level and condition of monitoring.\nIn order to achieve the above object, the present invention is the home security system that monitors an inside of a facility and comprises: a plurality of detection units operable to detect an alarming situation in different locations inside the facility; a plurality of image capturing units operable to capture an image in different locations inside the facility; an association memory unit operable to memorize associations between a plurality of the detection units and a plurality of the image capturing units; an updating unit operable to update the associations memorized in the association memory unit; and a control unit operable to, when one of a plurality of the detection units detects an alarming situation, have the image capturing unit which is associated with the detection unit that detects the alarming situation capture an image based on the associations memorized in the association memory unit.\nAccordingly, since the updating unit updates said associations, it becomes possible to vary as well as increase and decrease the locations of capturing images according to the level and condition of monitoring.\nAlso, in the home security system, a plurality of the detection units, a plurality of the image capturing units and the control unit may communicate each other via an electric power line.\nTherefore, when configuring the system in an already constructed house, a plurality of the detection units, a plurality of the image capturing units and the control unit can be connected using electric power lines that are already established in the house. As a result, not only that the system can be configured easily, but the detection units and the image capturing units can be added quite easily.\nThe home security system further comprises an image display unit, wherein the image capturing unit sends image data that indicates content of the captured image to the image display unit, and the image display unit displays the image captured by the image capturing unit based on the image data.\nAccordingly, since the image captured by the capturing unit is displayed on the image display unit, the state of alarm situations can be confirmed easily by viewing the images.\nAlso, the home security system may further comprise a server that communicates with the image display unit and provides an image via a communication line, wherein the image display unit sends the image data obtained from the image capturing unit to the server, and the server provides the image based on the image data to a device that accesses the server via the communication line.\nAccordingly, since the server provides the images captured by the image capturing unit via communication lines, the user is able to confirm the images captured by the image capturing units even from a place where he/she has gone by accessing the server using personal computers etc.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Multi-platinum alternative rock heavyweight, Incubus, announced rescheduled show dates at The Joint at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino after postponing their limited engagement in October 2017 following the 1 October tragedy.\n\nPresented by X107.5, performances are scheduled for Friday, Feb. 2 and Saturday, Feb. 3 and returning on Friday, March 30 and Saturday, March 31. Tickets go on sale Friday, Nov. 17 at 10 a.m.\n\nIncubus lead singer Brandon Boyd had this to say:\n\nWe are very happy to announce our new Las Vegas dates at The Joint! We postponed the original dates in October in light of the tragic events in Las Vegas, both out of a desire to honor those affected and as a precautionary measure.\n\nWe understand that changing the dates of a scheduled event was a pretty huge inconvenience for many of you and for that we do apologize, but if you’ll have us back we’ll happily make it up to you by playing louder and dancing harder than ever before.

{"text": "By Fareed Zakaria\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has won its campaign to be recognized as a non-member state of the United Nations. The question now is whether this will change anything.\n\nProbably no. It will give the Palestinians a little more recognition and greater legal status in certain international fora. But the vote doesn’t change the reality that the only way the Palestinians are going to get a state is if Israel decides that it is in its interests to make it happen. Israel has the power on the ground, The country’s leaders have made it clear that they are not going to be pressured by the UN, defeated in battle, they are not going to be intimidated, they are not going to be terrorized – I think the history of the last three decades has made all of this very clear.\n\nSo the question the Palestinians should be asking themselves is, how do we get the Israelis to see this as in their interests?\n\nThere was an intriguing column earlier this week by Jeffrey Goldberg, who makes a suggestion that has also been made by some Palestinians in the past, that the Palestinians should stop pushing for a two-state solution, and instead push for a one-state answer.\n\nHere’s how I would imagine the scenario unfolding: Mahmoud Abbas would announce that he is dissolving the Palestinian Authority in three months because he has recognized that there is no prospect that it will lead to a state under the current framework. He would also explain that he is returning all obligations and authority to the state of Israel.\n\nMore from CNN: Palestinian move won't change anything\n\nPalestinians would then start a process of non-violent protests and agitation, asking that they be given what every other person under the authority of the Israeli government has, namely the right to vote in Israeli elections.\n\nThe effect of this kind of strategy, would be to force the Israeli public to ask itself whether it was really willing to deny the Palestinians the right to vote. And if they were not willing to deny the Palestinians this right, wouldn’t it be much better to allow them to vote in their own state, rather than the state of Israel, because allowing them to vote in Israel would, of course, fundamentally compromise the Jewish character of Israel.\n\nThis is all somewhat far fetched. But the lesson from it is that the Palestinians really have to have a strategy that is geared more directly at persuading, convincing, cajoling – or perhaps even pushing – Israel to make some moves on this front. Getting the United Nations and the council of world opinion to do this is essentially meaningless, because nobody has the ability to make this happen other than the Israelis.\n\nThe question Abbas needs to be asking is not whether the Palestinians can get Ban Ki-moon to give them a state, but can they get Benjamin Netanyahu to give them one?", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "1. Field of the Disclosure\nThe present disclosure relates generally to testing die on wafer and, more particularly, to testing of die on wafer using a reduced pin count JTAG interface. The reduced JTAG interface enables a larger number of die on wafer to be contacted by low cost testers and tested, which results in lowering the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits.\n2. Description of Related Art\nToday more and more wafer testing is being performed by low cost wafer testers. Low cost wafer testers are achieved primarily in two ways. (1) Decreasing the number of test contacts, and therefore expensive tester interfacing circuitry and probing mechanisms, between the tester and die on wafer, and (2) including more design for test circuitry (i.e. built in self test circuitry, scan design circuitry, test data compression/decompression circuitry) in the die to reduce the amount of test circuitry required in the tester. Furthermore wafer test cost can be reduced by using standardized design for test interfaces and circuitry in the die, such as the IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) interface. The IEEE 1149.1 serial interface allows die on wafer to be tested via a standard 5 wire interface consisting of a test data input (TDI), a test data output (TDO), a test clock (TCK), a test mode select (TMS), and a test reset (TRST) signal. Using this interface, the tester only needs to contact each die using these 5 test signals to input and output test data and instructions. While the IEEE 1149.1 interface can be used for wafer testing, it still requires 5 contacts per die on wafer. For example, if 500 die on wafer are to be tested in parallel, the tester would have to have 2500 contacts to the wafer (500 die×5 signals each). Additionally, the IEEE 1149.1 serial interface bandwidth is relatively low since the TCK signal that times the interface typically operates at a frequency of only 20 to 50 MHz.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The median survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one year. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radioactive therapy have continuously improved, long-term survival from GBM has not improved since 1950. One of the methods that have been hypothesized to provide more effective treatment for GBM is through immunomodulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we previously determined that immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) are found in human GBM, which is recapitulated in experimental mouse models of glioma. Using an experimental mouse model of glioma, we also determined that Treg depletion increases long-term survival. Based on those discoveries, this research proposal aims to extend those observations by investigating the immunomodulatory enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), which is currently being targeted in Phase 1 clinical trials for breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers, as well as melanoma. IDO has been shown to regulate the conversion of Treg into IL-17A-producing pro- inflammatory CD4+ T helper 17 cells (Th17s). However, no previous investigation has determined the roles of IDO and Th17s in GBM. Therefore, this study aims to identify: 1) the role of IDO, 2) the role of Th17s and 3) the mechanism by which IDO regulates Treg/Th17 levels in orthotopic and transgenic mouse models of glioma. Aim 1 will provide an analysis of in vivo transgenic and orthotopic mouse models of glioma in combination with select IDO deficiency using wild-type (WT), IDO-/- and CD4-/- mice, IDO inhibitors, IDO knockdown with shRNA and CD4+ T- and dendritic cell-adoptive transfers. The changes in IDO mRNA levels, IDO enzyme activity, IDO protein localization, Treg/Th17 levels and glioma invasiveness will be analyzed and correlated to mouse survival. Aim 2 will critically test in vivo orthotopic mouse models of glioma with selective IL-17A deficiency using WT-, IL-17A-/--, ROR3t-/-- and CD4-/--mice, in conjunction with CD4+ T cell adoptive transfers. The changes in Treg/Th17 frequency, Treg/Th17-related cell surface and cytokine expression, IL- 17A protein expression, IDO enzyme activity and glioma invasiveness will be analyzed and correlated to mouse survival. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism by which IDO regulates Treg/Th17 conversion in vivo using IL-17 reporter-, CD4-/--, CD4+pSTAT5-/--, and CD4+pSTAT3-/--orthotopic mouse models of glioma 1IDO inhibition with CD4+ T cell adoptive transfers. The changes in Treg/Th17 frequency, pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 levels in CD4+ T cells, conversion of adoptively transferred Tregs and Th17s, absolute Treg/Th17 numbers, and CD4+CD25+-, CD4+CD25+IL-17+-, CD4+IL-17+-T cell suppressor capacity will be analyzed. Human GBM is a fatal type of glioma, which results in the infiltration of Tregs and Th17s, as well as the selective expression of IDO. This proposal aims to understand the roles that IDO plays in maintaining the balance between Tregs and Th17s using pre-clinical experimental mouse models of malignant glioma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system of glial origin with a median survival time of 15 months. We and others have shown that CD4+ T lymphocytes infiltrate human GBM, as well as mouse models that recapitulate GBM, leading to studies demonstrating that, immunomodulation is a potential target for future treatment of GBM. To further these studies, this proposal aims to investigate the role of indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), the role of t helper 17 cells (Th17s) and the molecular mechanism by which IDO regulates Treg/Th17 levels using intracranially-injected and spontaneously-developing mouse models of GBM.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Bracing For Hurricanes: A Qualitative Analysis of the Extent and Level of Preparedness Among Older Adults.\nOlder adults are at greater risk than other age groups throughout all stages of a disaster. To date, the bulk of empirical disaster research concerning older adults has centered on the consequences of a disaster. This study focuses on older residents in a hurricane-prone community and investigates the extent and level of their reported preparedness for hurricanes, which takes place prior to a disaster. This study engaged year-round older residents of Sarasota County, Florida. Semi-structured interviews were conducted for 30 older individuals of 60-90 years of age. Transcripts were analyzed by qualitative content analysis integrating both inductive and deductive coding approaches. Older respondents overwhelmingly practiced survival preparedness by only storing water and food supplies, but lacked efforts in planning and structural preparedness due to insufficient awareness and financial resources. Most respondents asserted hurricane readiness despite the shortage of preparation practices because \"being prepared\" is defined differently for different individuals. Many respondents claimed hurricane experience and subjective interpretation rather than objective nature of prior exposure appeared to have a greater influence over respondents' reported preparedness behavior. This study adds to the emerging, but highly limited body of work specifically addressing disaster preparedness among older adults. The interview data inclusive of respondents' voices and values suggest that expectations by emergency managers that older individuals will follow hurricane preparedness recommendations may be misplaced. More practical and age-specific interventions are needed to promote disaster preparedness of older adults.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Relevant medical records and supporting documentation from any potential incident clinical events identified by phone or postcard contact were obtained by the clinical center and forwarded to the data coordinating center. For fatal events, the death certificate and hospital records from the time of death (if available) were collected. For fatal events that did not occur in hospital, a proxy interview with next of kin and hospital records from the most recent hospitalization in the past 12 months were obtained. These documents were used to determine the underlying cause of death.

VAT is contained in the visceral cavity inside the medial edges of the abdominal wall musculature, but this area also includes SAT anterior and posterior to the abdominal wall musculature superimposed on the 2‐dimensional projection. The amount of SAT in the medial VAT area can be estimated from the SAT lateral to the abdominal wall musculature, and the estimated visceral fat area (cm^2^) is then calculated as total adipose tissue overlying and within the visceral cavity minus the SAT overlying this area.\n\n![Measurement of visceral adipose tissue on dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry.](JAH3-7-e009172-g002){#jah33368-fig-0002}\n\nThe android region of interest was situated above the line between the right and left iliac crests and below the horizontal line 20% of the distance between the inferior boundary and the chin. Fat mass measurements in the android region included both VAT and SAT. The upper boundary of the gynoid region was a line drawn a distance 1.5 times the height of the android region below the iliac crests, and the gynoid region lower boundary was a line 2 times the height of the android region below the upper boundary.[23](#jah33368-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\nOther Covariates {#jah33368-sec-0012}\n----------------\n\nHeight was measured with a Harpenden stadiometer, weight recorded with a balance beam or electronic scale, and BMI calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m^2^) at the MrOS Sleep baseline visit. Participants self‐reported if they were a current or a past smoker, if they were currently taking aspirin or a statin medication, whether or not they were using medications for hypertension, and whether or not they had been diagnosed previously by a physician with a myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson\\'s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, liver disease, or renal disease. Systolic blood pressure was measured in the right arm twice with the participant sitting, and averaged. Oxidized low‐density lipoproteins were measured on Beckman Coulter Biomek NXp (Beckman Coulter, Inc, Fullerton, CA) using a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Oxidized LDL ELISA; Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\nStatistical Analyses {#jah33368-sec-0013}\n--------------------\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants were compared in 2 groups, stratified by incident ASCVD outcome (yes versus no) using χ^2^ statistics for categorical variables, Student *t* test for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann--Whitney *U* test for continuous variables with a non‐normal distribution. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (per SD increase) of BMI (model 1), VAT (model 2), android‐to‐gynoid fat mass ratio (model 3), with incident ASCVD events, adjusted for age, education, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking (ever versus never), oxidized LDL level, treatment for hypertension, statin use, aspirin use, and presence of diabetes mellitus, censoring for ASCVD event, mortality for any cause, and loss to follow‐up. To test whether the associations of our primary adipose tissue varied by age, additional models were run including the appropriate interaction term (BMI\\*age, VAT\\*age, or \\[android/gynoid\\]\\*age). Schoenfeld residuals were used to test that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated.\n\nGluteofemoral adipose tissue may be protective against incident ASCVD and mortality, and some have therefore recommended that prediction models include measures of central and gluteofemoral adipose tissue as separate covariates in order to capture their independent effects, adjusted for each other, on outcome events.[14](#jah33368-bib-0014){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [15](#jah33368-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"} Therefore, we also estimated the separate associations of android and gynoid fat mass, adjusted for each other (model 4).\n\nGiven that weight loss is associated with and can even begin shortly before the onset of a variety of illnesses in older people,[24](#jah33368-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"} the \"obesity paradox\" may be a function of comorbid conditions that become more prevalent with age, rather than age per se. Hence, we repeated these analyses in men without major self‐reported physician diagnosed pre‐existing comorbid illness (prior myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson\\'s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, liver disease, or renal disease). For all models, postdiagnostic tests were done to ensure that the proportional hazards assumption for the adipose tissue predictor variables was not violated.\n\nResults {#jah33368-sec-0014}\n=======\n\nOver a mean follow‐up period of 7.9 (SD 3.4) years, 424 men (14.6%) experienced 1 or more incident ASCVD events; 102 (3.5%) died of coronary heart disease, 223 (7.7%) had an acute myocardial infarction, 133 (4.6%) had a nonfatal stroke, and 39 (1.3%) had a fatal stroke. Men who had an incident ASCVD event were older, had a higher systolic blood pressure, and were more likely to self‐report that they were using medication for hypertension at baseline (Table [1](#jah33368-tbl-0001){ref-type=\"table\"}).

This is consistent with the \"obesity paradox\" hypothesis that with advancing age adipose tissue depots may be associated with higher vitality reflected in lower burden of comorbid illness. However, we also did not find any association of VAT or android--gynoid fat mass ratio within the subset of older men without any pre‐existing major comorbid conditions. With advancing age, adipose tissue may also be associated with better preservation of muscle mass. Whether this, or other positive nutritional factors associated with higher levels of adipose tissue in adults over age 70 years, negate the negative effects of VAT are unknown.\n\nSome have hypothesized that central adipose tissue may be particularly deleterious among those with normal BMI (\"normal weight obesity\"). However, neither VAT nor android--gynoid fat mass ratio were associated with incident ASCVD in this subset of older men. Considered as separate predictors, gynoid fat mass adjusted for android fat mass may be protective against ASCVD events among older men with normal BMI. However, further studies would be required to confirm this and explicate the reason(s) for this association.\n\nOur findings are consistent with those from the Health ABC study where VAT predicted incident myocardial infarction among older women but not older men.[3](#jah33368-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"} That prior study had a relatively small number (71) of outcomes events; our study had a much larger number (424) of outcome events, and suggests that VAT is also not associated with a broader range of ASCVD outcomes in older men.\n\nWhile our study was not designed to examine the effects of interventions to reduce central obesity in these older men, our findings suggest that it is possible that weight loss to reduce central obesity among older obese individuals may not reduce their risks of incident ASCVD. On the other hand, weight loss results in loss of both fat and lean mass, and can reduce muscular strength and increase functional impairment even among obese individuals[25](#jah33368-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}; these changes may be particularly detrimental among very old adults who already have experienced significant age‐related loss of muscle mass,[26](#jah33368-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"} resulting in further functional decline[27](#jah33368-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"} and incident frailty.[28](#jah33368-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"} Therefore, the risks versus benefit of recommendations to lose weight need to be carefully considered in older men on a case‐by‐case basis. At the least, intentional weight loss in obese very old individuals should be accompanied by appropriate exercise and nutritional interventions to reduce or prevent the loss of lean mass and muscle strength and to preserve functional status.[29](#jah33368-bib-0029){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [30](#jah33368-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\nIt is uncertain why associations of central fat depots, including VAT, with incident ASCVD may weaken with age and may be different for older men versus older women. VAT is associated with metabolic risk factors such as high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol in both sexes, albeit somewhat more strongly in women.[31](#jah33368-bib-0031){ref-type=\"ref\"} Moreover, higher levels of VAT on DXA were associated with lower high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, greater insulin resistance, and lower adiponectin concentrations in this cohort of older men.[10](#jah33368-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"} However, the associations between VAT and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin‐6 are weak in older men.[10](#jah33368-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"} Whether or not the associations of inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines with central adiposity weaken with advancing age, and whether or not changes of these associations with age varies by sex, is not known.\n\nIt is also possible that the excess ASCVD risk conferred by central obesity simply becomes less important relative to other risk factors, known and unknown, associated with advancing age. Consistent with this, development and validation of the pooled ASCVD risk calculator of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology revealed that the associations of high‐density lipoprotein and total cholesterol with incident ASCVD weaken with advancing age in whites and blacks of both sexes.[21](#jah33368-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"} Similarly, the association of systolic blood pressure with incident ASCVD weakens with advancing age among black women.[21](#jah33368-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"} While we did not see that the association of VAT or android‐to‐gynoid fat mass ratio varied by age in these analyses, our cohort did not include men younger than age 65 years, and a larger age range may be necessary for this to be clearly seen.\n\nIt is also possible that men who survive to be at least age 70 years have VAT that is less injurious to the arterial vasculature compared with younger men. VAT is not homogeneous. For example, there is individual variability in regard to its density (as measured in Hounsfield units on CT), and less dense VAT is more strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.[31](#jah33368-bib-0031){ref-type=\"ref\"} Whether or not this or other characteristics of central adipose tissue depots are different for middle‐age compared with older men, and/or vary by sex is unknown. Further investigations of the associations of VAT characteristics with age and sex are needed.\n\nFinally, it may be that the extent of atherosclerotic vascular damage may be more strongly associated with the duration of exposure to a high level of VAT, rather than a 1‐time value. VAT tends to increase with increasing age[32](#jah33368-bib-0032){ref-type=\"ref\"}; hence, many men with a high level of VAT at the baseline MrOS sleep visit may not have had much VAT at earlier stages of their lives. If there is a tendency for middle‐aged men with lower levels of VAT to \"catch up\" to their peers who survive to advanced ages, that could weaken the association of a 1‐time VAT measurement at older ages with incident ASCVD events.\n\nThere are several important strengths of our study. Our study was conducted in a large cohort of older men with comprehensively assessed measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors and obesity. While enrollment in MrOS was limited to community‐dwelling men, characteristics of the MrOS study population resemble those of the older men enrolled in the population‐based National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey.[33](#jah33368-bib-0033){ref-type=\"ref\"} Incident ASCVD events were carefully adjudicated using a validated protocol. Our study had a large number (424) of outcome events and was well powered to detect small‐to‐modest associations of our main central adipose tissue measures with incident ASCVD events.\n\nThere are also limitations of this study. The MrOS cohort enrolled only older men and therefore is not generalizable to women or younger men. Furthermore, 90% of the present study cohort was white, and this might also limit generalizability to other racial or ethnic groups. We cannot rule out the possibility that measures of VAT using CT or magnetic resonance imaging are associated with incident ASCVD in older men. However, we think that is unlikely since DXA‐VAT is highly correlated with both CT[34](#jah33368-bib-0034){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [35](#jah33368-bib-0035){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [36](#jah33368-bib-0036){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [37](#jah33368-bib-0037){ref-type=\"ref\"} and magnetic resonance imaging[34](#jah33368-bib-0034){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [38](#jah33368-bib-0038){ref-type=\"ref\"} measures of VAT, and since DXA‐VAT is as strongly associated with cardiometabolic ASCVD risk factors as CT‐VAT in older men.[10](#jah33368-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"} Finally, we ascertained prior diagnoses of comorbid conditions at baseline by self‐report, and did not have medical records available to confirm self‐reported diagnoses.\n\nIn conclusion, central obesity, measured as VAT or android--gynoid fat mass ratio, was not associated with incident ASCVD events among this cohort of older community‐dwelling men.\n\nSources of Funding {#jah33368-sec-0016}\n==================\n\nThe Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study is supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and NIH Roadmap for Medical Research (grant numbers: U01 AG027810, U01 AG042124, U01 AG042139, U01 AG042140, U01 AG042143, U01 AG042145, U01 AG042168, U01 AR066160, and UL1 TR000128).

{"text": "Fundació Joan Miró\n\nThe Fundació Joan Miró () (, \"Joan Miró Foundation, Centre of Studies of Contemporary Art\") is a museum of modern art honoring Joan Miró located on the hill called Montjuïc in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain).\n\nHistory\nThe idea for the foundation was made in 1968 by Joan Miró. Miró formed the foundation with his friend Joan Prats. Miró wanted to create a new building that would encourage particularly younger artists to experiment with contemporary art. The building was designed by Josep Lluís Sert to ensure that this work could also be made available to the public and exhibited. He designed the building with courtyards and terraces and to create a natural path for visitors to move through the building.\n\nBuilding began on the mountain of Montjuïc and the foundation opened on 10 June 1975. Not only was the architect a close friend of Miró but so was the first president Joaquim Gomis and Miró was amongst the first board. It was claimed that the new foundation represented a new way of viewing the concept of a museum and how the people of Barcelona could relate to their cultural heritage.\n\nExpansion in 1986 to the building added an auditorium and a library which holds some of the 10,000 items in the Foundation and Miró's collection.\n\nWorks by Joan Miró\nMany of the works in the building were donated by the artist himself. Highlights include:\nThe wing of the lark ..., 1967\nHermitage of San Juan Huerta, 1917\nStreet Pedralbes, 1917\nPortrait of a boy, 1919\nPainting (the white gloves), 1925\nFlame in space and Naked woman, 1932\nCharacter, 1934\nMan and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement, 1935\nNaked woman climbing a staircase, 1937\nNo, 1937\nThe Morning Star, 1940\nBarcelona Series, 1944\nThe Diamond smiles at twilight, 1947–1948\nThe Caress of a Bird, 1967\nThe gold of the azure, 1967\nPainting on white to a solitary cell I, II, III, 1968\nFigure in front of the sun, 1968\nCatalan peasant by moonlight, 1968\nMiró's Chicago, 1968\nCharacter, 1970, May 1968, 1968–1973\nTapestry of the Fundació, 1979\n\nCollection\nIn line with Miró's original idea the Foundation has a space named \"\" which is dedicated to promoting the work of young experimental artists. Although there is also work by Peter Greenaway, Chillida, René Magritte, Rothko, Tàpies and Saura.\n\nThe collection includes Alexander Calder's 4 Wings and Mercury Fountain. The Mercury Fountain uses the liquid metal mercury to create a fountain. As mercury is poisonous, the fountain is kept behind glass to protect the visitors.\n\nThe museum uses QRpedia to allow visitors to read Wikipedia articles about objects in the collection, translated into their preferred language.\n\nEspai 13 \nThe Fundació Joan Miró has had a space for exhibiting contemporary art, with regular and continuous programming. Espai 10, active since 1978, and Espai 13, which took over after 1989 to continue through to the present day, together offer an area of analysis that is unique within Spain and also Europe as a whole. This exhibition space has been working as a laboratory of\ncutting-edge art, a space for programming experimental exhibitions of contemporary art, and has functioned over more than three decades in a major institution as an art centre within an institution. Besides providing a venue for local artists, it has also been a place of constant international interchange. Moreover, the broad span of over thirty years has made it possible not only to analyse the history of movements, patterns and trends in art but also to detect intersections between different generations and languages. In brief, Espai 10 and Espai 13 provide a privileged place from which to study, moreover, the ways in which theories and socio-political contexts have kept influencing artistic production over the decades when the different kinds of infrastructure that opened up the field of contemporary Spanish and Catalan art were taking shape. Hence, the history of Espai 10 and Espai 13 may be viewed as that of a well-informed witness, or an archive that can be compared and contrasted with many others from the same period.\n\nVenue hire and private visits \nDifferent spaces can be rented for the celebration of events and activities. The Fundació Joan Miró provides the perfect setting for all sorts of private and corporate events. The building and its gardens with views overlooking Barcelona offer exceptional spaces for holding meetings and company events. In addition, the Fundació offers exclusive private tours of the different rooms in the museum featuring the largest collection of Miró’s work in the world.\n\nSee also\n List of museums in Barcelona\n Joan Miró: The Ladder of Escape\n Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró in Mallorca\n\nExternal links\n Museum website\n Venue hire and private visits\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Buildings and structures completed in 1975\nCategory:Art museums and galleries in Barcelona\nCategory:Modern art museums in Catalonia\nMiro, Joan\nCategory:Foundations based in Catalonia\nCategory:Sants-Montjuïc\nCategory:Modernist architecture in Barcelona\nCategory:Art museums established in 1975\nCategory:1975 establishments in Spain\nCategory:1975 establishments in Catalonia\nMiro, Joan\nCategory:Joan Miró", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Abstract:\nThis record relates to the Australian component of the Latitudinal Gradient Project. The LGP is largely a New Zealand, US and Italian venture, but a small contribution has been made by Australian scientists.\n\nThe Australian component of this work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2361 and 2682 (ASAC_2361, and ASAC_2682).\n\nData from this project were entered into the herbarium access ... database, which has been linked to this record.\n\nThe list below contains details of where and when samples were collected, and also the type of sample and the method of sampling.\n\nProject objectives: 1. Investigate the distribution of bryophytes and lichens in continental Antarctica 1a). to test the null hypothesis that species diversity does not change significantly with latitude; 1b). to explore the relationships between species and key environmental attributes including latitude, distance from the coast, temperature, substrate, snow cover, age of ice-free substrate.\n\n2. To continue to participate in the Ross Sea Sector Latitudinal Gradient Project and develop an Australian corollary in the Prince Charles Mountains, involving international collaborators, incorporating the first two objectives of this project.\n\n3. To develop an international collaborative biodiversity and ecophysiological program in the Prince Charles Mountains that will provide a parallel N-S latitude gradient study to mirror the LGP program in the Ross Sea region as part of the present RISCC cooperative program (to be superseded by the EBA (Evolution and Biodiversity of Antarctica) program) to address the above objectives.\n\nTaken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report: Progress against objectives: Continuing identification of moss and lichen samples previously collected from Cape Hallett, Granite Harbour and Darwin Glacier region. Lecidea s.l. lichens currently being studied in Austria by PhD student. Field work in Dry Valleys significantly curtailed by adverse weather. Field work planned for Darwin Glacier region and McMurdo Dry Valleys, particularly Taylor Valley and Granite Harbour region was severely curtailed due to adverse weather, helicopter diversions due to a Medical Evacuation, and other logistic constraints. 10 days of field time were lost. Limitations on field travel in Darwin Glacier region restricted the field work to a biologically depauperate region. The Prince Charles Mountains N-S transect, the only continental transect possibility for comparison with the Ross Sea area, unfortunately appears to have been abandoned through lack of logistic support.\n\nTaken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report: Identification of samples collected from AAT and Ross Sea Region continued during the year, interrupted significantly by the packing of the collection and transfer of specimens to the Tasmanian Herbarium. Work is now proceeding at the Herbarium with sorting, databasing and incorporation of packets into the Herbarium collection. The merging of the collection provides long-term security of curation and significantly boosts the cryptogam collections (35000 numbers) of the Tasmanian Herbarium.\n\nQuality\nThe values provided in temporal and spatial coverage are approximate only.\n\nTaken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report: Variations to work plan or objectives: Logistic constraints limited field time, necessitating major changes in the ... field. Transfer of the herbarium ADT to HO required considerable time input.\n\nField work: 4 weeks of field work were planned for the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. Two weeks were lost due to adverse weather (heavy snow falls) and helicopter schedule rearrangements due to a medical evacuation from the field. Ground based studies were carried out at Granite Harbour (with abandonment of work proposed for inland mountains) and in the Darwin Glacier region (where adverse weather and a biotically poor area limited field time to 3 days. Collections of plants made are currently being identified and will provide comparative biodiversity indices for other multi-disciplinary whole ecosystem studies currently being undertaken in the southern Dry Valleys region. Amolecular phylogenetic and taxonomic revision of Lecidea s.l., lichens is being undertaken by an Austrian PhD student and should be completed late 2009.\n\nLaboratory activity/analysis: Morphological examination of specimens from AAT and Ross Sea Sector is ongoing. As material is fully identified the data is prepared as herbarium packets and incorporated into the Herbarium (ADT - being transferred to the Tasmanian Herbarium HO) and to the AAD Data Centre.\n\nAccess Constraints\nMain LGP data are accessible through the Antarctica New Zealand, LGP Web site.\n\nAustralian data collected by Rod Seppelt are currently held within the ADT Herbarium.

{"text": "Those of you who follow us on Social Media will immediately know how strongly Ruby & Sofia advocate for the Millions of abused and forgotten animals that enter our Shelter System every year. Millions of loving, well behaved, loyal animals that enter the 'shelter' system most likely will never leave. The state and city funded facilities are failing these animals tenfold as the majority of animals who enter these facilities will most likely die in these facilities, save for the few who are rescued -\n\nRescue is a is a twofold tale, for behind a broken system of forgotten animals is a group of people working endlessly, tirelessly and sometimes fruitlessly for these very animals that society has 'thrown away'. Rescue is a hard choice for anyone, but for some it is the only choice..\n\nShelter of the month will highlight the chosen rescue, the journey of the people behind the rescue and the animals they have saved and lost.

{"text": "Anthony Chickillo\n\nAnthony Chickillo (born December 10, 1992) is an American football outside linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Miami.\n\nEarly years\nChickillo attended Gaither High School in Tampa, Florida prior to transferring to Braulio Alonso High School, which is also in Tampa, before his junior year. As a senior, he had 140 tackles, 18 sacks and two interceptions. Chickillo was named the MVP of the 2011 Under Armour All-America Game after he recorded 1.5 sacks and a fumble recovery. He was rated by Rivals.com as a four-star recruit and was ranked as the third best defensive end in his class. He committed to the University of Miami to play college football.\n\nCollege career\nChickillo played at Miami from 2011 to 2014. He entered his freshman season as a backup before becoming a starter. After three games, he became a starter and would start the next 47 games through his senior year. He finished his career with 170 tackles and 15.5 sacks.\n\nProfessional career\nComing out of college, Chickillo was projected by some analysts to be a fourth to sixth-round draft pick. He was rated the 13th-best defensive end out of the 148 available by NFLDraftScout.com. Many scouts were divided on what position he was best suited for and classified him as a tweener. He received mostly mixed reviews from analysts and was thought to be a future rotational defensive end. Chickillo was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine and was able to participate in the full workout and complete all the positional drills. He also attended Miami's Pro Day but was satisfied with his combine performance and only did positional workouts. Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin attended his pro day and has said he envisioned Chickillo switching to an outside linebacker.\n\n2015\nOn May 2, 2015, Chickillo was drafted by the Steelers in the sixth round (212th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. Chickillo was the 24th defensive end drafted in 2015.\n\nOn May 11, 2015, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Chickillo to a four-year, $2.37 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $73,700.\n\nOn September 6, 2015, he was waived by the Steelers after initially making the 53-man roster. He was signed to the practice squad three days later. On September 30, 2015, Chickillo was activated from the practice squad to the Steelers' active roster.\n\nOn October 18, 2015, he appeared in his first career game against the Arizona Cardinals.\nHe appeared in seven regular-season games for the Steelers in his rookie year, recording six tackles and forcing a fumble. The following week, he recorded his first tackle during a 23–13 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He had a season-high two tackles and forced a fumble during the Steelers' Week 17 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Chickillo finished his rookie season with a total of six combined tackles and a forced fumble, while appearing in seven regular-season contests and two postseason games.\n\n2016\nHe began his second season as the third left outside linebacker on the depth chart behind Bud Dupree and Arthur Moats. Although he was mainly featured on special teams, he began to receive more reps as a rotational outside linebacker after Dupree missed the first ten games due to an abdominal injury.\n\nOn October 9, 2016, Chickillo recorded three solo tackles, a forced fumble, and his first career sack on New York Jets' quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, during the Steelers' 31–13 victory. The following week, he earned his first career start against the Miami Dolphins and finished the loss with three solo tackles. During a Week 9 13–21 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Chickillo made a season-high six combined tackles and was credited with a half a sack on Joe Flacco. The next game, he made a total of four tackles, forced a fumble, and sacked Dak Prescott during a 30–35 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n2017\nOn February 14, 2017, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Chickillo to a one-year, $615,000 restricted free agent tender. He returned as the Steelers' third left outside linebacker behind Dupree and Moats, but began the regular season featured on special teams.\n\nOn September 10, in the season-opening 21–18 victory over the Cleveland Browns, Chickillo had two sacks. In addition, Tyler Matakevich blocked a punt, which Chickillo recovered in the end zone for his first career touchdown and gave the Steelers their first points of the season.\n\n2018\nOn March 13, 2018, the Pittsburgh Steelers extended an original round tender offer to Chickillo as a restricted free agent. On April 21, 2018, Chickillo officially signed his one-year, $1.90 million contract.\n\n2019\nOn March 12, 2019, Chickillo signed a two-year, $8 million contract extension with the Steelers. After he was arrested for domestic violence on October 20, 2019, he was placed on the exempt/commissioner's permission list on October 23, 2019. The domestic violence charges were withdrawn on October 30, and he was brought back to the active roster on October 31.\n\nPersonal life\nHis father Tony Chickillo and grandfather Nick Chickillo both played at the University of Miami and in the NFL.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMiami Hurricanes bio\n\nCategory:1992 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida\nCategory:Players of American football from Florida\nCategory:American people of Italian descent\nCategory:American football defensive tackles\nCategory:American football defensive ends\nCategory:Miami Hurricanes football players\nCategory:Pittsburgh Steelers players\nCategory:American football linebackers", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nJava library for ReCaptcha that does not utilize Google ReCaptcha\n\nI am developing a ReCaptcha for a site. Because of client's requirement, I cannot use Google ReCaptcha and anything in the cloud. Basically, I need a library that can be installed on my local machine, does not make remote request when I use it. The library must be able to run in Java. \nI have been trying to find such thing, but have had no luck.  Does anyone know any?\n\nA:\n\nYou could generate CAPTCHA images on your own server without connecting to any external servers as follows:\n\nDraw text on an image that contains letters and/or numbers.\nUse image processing to distort or camouflage the contents of the image to make it hard for OCR software to correctly read it.\nDisplay the image on the website, possibly with a secondary mechanism like asking a common-sense question from a question bank.\n\nFor the second step (image processing), the company I work for has an image processing Java library that contains hundreds of functions. I took sample images with digits in them and wrote code to perform random distortions on them. The attached image shows 2 input images alongside the output that resulted from running the code on them.\n\nThis is the code I used:\npublic void GenerateCaptcha(RasterImage image) {\n   Random r = new Random(); \n\n   // Add some white noise to combat edge detection algorithms\n   AddNoiseCommand addNoise = new AddNoiseCommand(50 + r.nextInt(50), RasterColorChannel.MASTER);\n   addNoise.run(image);\n\n   int stepDiv = 3;\n   int xstep = image.getImageWidth() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n   int ystep = image.getImageHeight() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n   for (int x = 0; x < image.getImageWidth(); x += xstep)\n   {\n      for (int y = 0; y < image.getImageHeight(); y += ystep)\n      {\n         xstep = image.getImageWidth() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n         ystep = image.getImageHeight() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n         LeadRect rect = new LeadRect();\n         rect.setLeft(x - xstep);\n         rect.setTop(y - ystep);\n         xstep = image.getImageWidth() * 2 / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n         ystep = image.getImageHeight() * 2 / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n         rect.setWidth(xstep);\n         rect.setHeight(ystep);\n         image.addEllipseToRegion(null, rect, RasterRegionCombineMode.SET);\n         InvertCommand invert = new InvertCommand();\n         int brightness = r.nextInt(400) - 200;\n         ChangeIntensityCommand intensity = new ChangeIntensityCommand(brightness);\n         intensity.run(image);\n         invert.run(image);\n         ystep = image.getImageHeight() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n      }\n      xstep = image.getImageWidth() / (stepDiv + r.nextInt(stepDiv));\n   }\n   image.makeRegionEmpty();\n\n   // Add a bit more white noise\n   addNoise.run(image);\n}\n\nIf you would like to try the library, there’s a free evaluation edition on this page.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Hot on the heels of announcing the Canadian version of Big Brother coming to Slice, executive producer John Brunton says they’ve already been overwhelmed by hopeful contestants and hosts.\n\n“What’s amazing we’ve just had the most bizarrely aggressive response since that press release went out yesterday,” said Brunton, CEO of Insight Productions.\n\n“I think I’ve had 10 emails already from people that want to host the show, some known and others who have been in the news lately, and we’ve got hundreds of emails from people that want to be in the show,” he says.\n\n“People have been sending photos in. Weird photos. I know Canadians are considered to be shy, but we definitely aren’t seeing that.”\n\nBrunton says the company had its first pre-production meeting about the show on Thursday and are hoping to potentially start shooting early in 2013, with a location somewhere in Toronto.\n\nThe key to any reality show is casting and Brunton is looking forward to that.\n\n“The casting is going to be so much fun, because it’s kind of hot mess TV a bit,” he says. “We have experience doing that from our other shows, but this is different from looking for people who can dance or sing.”\n\nThey want to cast as wide a net as possible but are still firming up details as to how it might unfold.\n\nInsight Productions is partnering with Endemol, the company that has spread the mammoth franchise around the world. Insight has a long history with bringing and creating reality formats in this country, with credits like Battle of the Blades, Canadian Idol and Canada’s Got Talent, but Brunton says those shows do not compare to the scope of this production.\n\n“This show is a major viewing commitment, three hours a week, but the complications of pulling it off as a production are really exciting to us. It’s new technology, it’s building a house inside a studio that you can shoot in, that people have to live in, that has real plumbing and all that stuff,” he says.\n\n“There’s something really fascinating to us about the format and to us it’s a big, big, big show. It shoots for over 70 days, 24-7, and it never stops.”", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Then move the definition of Db::instance outside of the class, but remember to explicitly mark it inline. Of have a source file where you implement the Db::instance function, and only forward declare the MySQLDb class in the \"db.hpp2\" header file, not include the \"mysqldb.hpp\" file.\nAfter doing that you will have another problem, namely that the MySQLDb constructor is private and the Db class can't access it. This can be solved by making Db a friend of MySQLDb.\n\nHowever all of this, the circular dependency and making Db a friend is a sign of a bad design, IMO.\nI might instead do something like having Db a pure abstract class, and move the factory-function somewhere else. Maybe using templates.\nSingletons and inheritance seldom play well together.\nFurthermore, what if you want to have multiple simultaneous connections? Perhaps to different databases of different kinds? Can't use the singleton pattern then.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Cardiovascular calcification in nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major health-care problem of global proportions. Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the need for renal replacement therapy, and the high annual death rate of dialysis patients are the most noticeable outcomes of CKD. Less appreciated, however, is the fact that most patients with CKD actually die mainly from cardiovascular disease, rather than progress to ESRD. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, is common in dialysis and CKD patients. Coronary artery calcium scores, as measured by ultrafast computed tomography, is an independent predictor of future cardiac events. Using this technique, several studies have documented extensive calcification in dialysis patients, a subject of several exhaustive reviews. Unfortunately, much less attention has been paid to calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD. In this review, I will emphasize the fact that CVC is common in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis, develops early in the course of CKD, and worsens with the decline in renal function particularly among diabetics who progressed to ESRD. I will also discuss the pathogenesis of CVC in CKD patients and highlight the lack of a major role for abnormalities of mineral metabolism in the pathogenesis of calcification in CKD patients. In addition to the high prevalence of traditional risk factors for CAD, the presence of proteinuria, reduced renal function, diabetic nephropathy, and the rate of progression to ESRD may represent the main uremia-related factors that increase the risk for calcification in CKD. Finally, I will review the protective role of inhibitors of calcification in CKD.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Sunday, December 31, 2017\n\nWell, so that is that. Now we must dismantle the tree,Putting the decorations back into their cardboard boxes –Some have got broken – and carrying them up to the attic.The holly and the mistletoe must be taken down and burnt,And the children got ready for school. There are enoughLeft-overs to do, warmed-up, for the rest of the week –Not that we have much appetite, having drunk such a lot,Stayed up so late, attempted – quite unsuccessfully –To love all of our relatives, and in generalGrossly overestimated our powers. Once againAs in previous years we have seen the actual Vision and failedTo do more than entertain it as an agreeablePossibility, once again we have sent Him away,Begging though to remain His disobedient servant,The promising child who cannot keep His word for long.The Christmas Feast is already a fading memory,And already the mind begins to be vaguely awareOf an unpleasant whiff of apprehension at the thoughtOf Lent and Good Friday which cannot, after all, nowBe very far off. But, for the time being, here we all are,Back in the moderate Aristotelian cityOf darning and the Eight-Fifteen, where Euclid's geometryAnd Newton's mechanics would account for our experience,And the kitchen table exists because I scrub it.It seems to have shrunk during the holidays. The streetsAre much narrower than we remembered; we had forgottenThe office was as depressing as this. To those who have seenThe Child, however dimly, however incredulously,The Time Being is, in a sense, the most trying time of all.For the innocent children who whispered so excitedlyOutside the locked door where they knew the presents to beGrew up when it opened. Now, recollecting that momentWe can repress the joy, but the guilt remains conscious;Remembering the stable where for once in our livesEverything became a You and nothing was an It.\n\nThis selection is excerpted from Auden’s long poem “For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio” (1942), which can be read in full in W.H. Auden: Collected Poems (Modern Library, 2007, Copyright by The Estate of W.H. Auden).\n\nMonday, December 25, 2017\n\nFaithful God, you chose Mary, full of grace, to be the mother of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now fill us with your grace, that with her, we may understand your ways, rejoice in your salvation, and embrace your will; through Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.\n\nOn this holy morning of Christmas, let us ponder anew the birth of our savior, of Jesus surrounded by love in the manger. On WMNR on Tuesday, our local classical station, I heard a Middle English lyrical poem or Carol of the 15th century that frames the Nativity with a song sung by the Virgin Mary to the infant Christ - \"Lullaby, mine liking\"\n\nI saw a fair maiden, sitting and sing, She lulled a little child a sweet lording: Refrain\n\nThat very lord is He that made all things Of all lords He is Lord (and) King of all king. Refrain\n\nThere was mickle (much) melody at that Child's birth, All that were in heaven's bliss, they made mickle (much) mirth. Refrain\n\nAngels bright they sang that night and saiden to that Child, \"Blessed be Thou, and so be she that is both meek and mild.\" Refrain\n\nPray we now to that Child, and to His mother dear, Grant them His blessing that now maken cheer. Refrain\n\nI love this lullaby. It is such a soothing tale, I can see Mary giving a lullaby (Lullay, my dear heart, mine own dear darling) . So let us ponder how we welcome the holy family. In his book Once Upon a Time in Africa, Father Joseph Healey recounts a true story of a young couple expecting their first child.\n\nLate on December 24, the young mother-to-be sensed something was wrong. The couple was alone: all their neighbors were away or busy with preparing for the great Christmas feast; some were involved in campaigning for the general election that was just a few weeks away. The couple went to the nearest maternity hospital, but there was no one to attend to her because the doctors and nurses were on strike and the watchman wanted a bribe before he would let them in.\n\nOn the way home, they met a homeless family who were living on the streets. They immediately recognized what was wrong and made a comfortable place for the expectant mother to lie down. Then they helped with her delivery. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy whom they named Samuel. Street children gave the newborn baby simple gifts, including their only toys: glue and a ripped ball. The couple made their way home, deeply grateful for the help offered by this homeless family. Could Mary and Joseph and the Child Jesus have been better cared for?\n\nRemember this story today as you enjoy this wonderful holy day - and keep in mind that those you welcome, those you share the holiday with, are Christ, and that the love of God is in your midst.\n\nWelcome them as you would welcome the Holy Family; offer them not only the hospitality of your table and hearth but welcome them with the compassion and peace of the heart that makes the simplest gift and fare celebrations of the love of God in our midst.\n\nAnd may all you do be a lullaby, a caring for the Christ child in your midst for the stable is our heart. Amen.\n\nSunday, December 24, 2017\n\nFaithful God, you chose Mary, full of grace, to be the mother of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now fill us with your grace, that with her, we may understand your ways, rejoice in your salvation, and embrace your will; through Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.\n\nThat poem from 1973 from Madeline L’engle gets me thinking about Love being born for us this night. God risking it all with the birth of a child.\n\nOn WMNR on Tuesday, our local classical station, I heard a Middle English lyrical poem or Carol of the 15th century that frames the Nativity with a song sung by the Virgin Mary to the infant Christ - \"Lullaby, mine liking\" and in those words from Mary to Jesus, I could imagine love surrounding him there in the manger. Here are the words:\n\nI saw a fair maiden, sitting and sing, She lulled a little child a sweet lording: Refrain\n\nThat very lord is He that made all things Of all lords He is Lord (and) King of all king. Refrain\n\nThere was mickle (much) melody at that Child's birth,\nAll that were in heaven's bliss, they made mickle (much) mirth. Refrain\n\nAngels bright they sang that night and saiden to that Child, \"Blessed be Thou, and so be she that is both meek and mild.\" Refrain\n\nPray we now to that Child, and to His mother dear, Grant them His blessing that now maken cheer. Refrain\n\nI love this lullaby. I can picture Mary near Jesus at the Nativity, giving him a lullaby (Lullay, mine Liking, my dear Son, mine Sweeting, Lullay, my dear heart, mine own dear darling), soothing him while Joseph watches. It is a beautiful scene. Such a blessing. We too are called to be such a blessing…\n\nIn a story I read recently, I read this snippet:\n\nEvery evening she could hear the newborn in the apartment next door cry and cry. The parents put the child to sleep alone in the dark. The baby cries for a long time; the exhausted parents clearly are oblivious to their child's anguish or are at a loss as to what to do.\n\nWhat can and should she do? She's not sure. Speaking to the parents might make what is just an annoying situation into something much worse. So she decides to sing.\n\nJust as she can hear the baby, the baby can hear her. So every evening when her mom and dad put the child to sleep, she sings lullabies and cradlesongs, talks softly and reassuringly to the baby through the walls, consoles and comforts the child. The baby hears her invisible friendly voice and falls asleep peacefully, without a tear or whimper. [From The Power of Kindness by Piero Ferrucci.]\n\nLet us in word and deed proclaim our saviors birth, following Mary’s example, sharing her love for Jesus in quiet and serene ways. We can be such a voice of compassion, comfort, forgiveness and peace in even our smallest and simplest songs of love & kindness, in a world filled with too much hate and noise.\n\nDecember 17, 1943 - Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Christmas letter to his parents. He had been held for several months with no formal charges being made. In several earlier letters he had expressed the hope of being free by Christmas to celebrate the holiday with his family and close friends. By the time he writes this letter, he has given up on the hope of being free for Christmas…\n\nDear parents,\n\nAbove all, you must not think that I will let myself sink into depression during this lonely Christmas. It will take its own special place in a series of very different Christmases that I have celebrated in Spain, in America, in England, and I want in later years to be able to think back on these days not with shame but with a special pride. That is the only thing that no one can take from me.\n\nI don’t need to tell you how great my longing for freedom and for all of you is. But you have for so many decades provided us with Christmases so incomparably beautiful, that the grateful memories of them are strong enough to outshine even a dark Christmas.\n\nFrom a Christian point of view, a Christmas in a prison cell is no special problem. It will probably be celebrated here in this house more sincerely and with more meaning than outside where the holiday is observed in name only. Misery, poverty, loneliness, helplessness, and guilt mean something entirely different in the eyes of God than in the judgment of men.\n\nThat God turns directly toward the place where men are careful to turn away; that Christ was born in a stable because he found no room in the Inn—a prisoner grasps that better than someone else. For him it really is a joyous message, and because he believes it, he knows that he has been placed in the Christian fellowship that breaks all the bounds of time and space; and the months in prison lose their importance.\n\nOn Holy Evening (Christmas Eve) I will be thinking of all of you very much, and I would very much like for you to believe that I will have a few beautiful hours and my troubles will certainly not overcome me.\n\nIf one thinks of the terrors that have recently come to so many people [with the heavy allied fire bombings] in Berlin, then one first becomes conscious of how much we still have for which to be thankful. Overall, it will surely be a very silent Christmas, and the children will still be thinking back on it for a long time to come. And maybe in this way it becomes clear to many what Christmas really is. . .\n\nAlmighty and everlasting God, you have stooped to raise our humanity by the child-bearing of blessed Mary; grant that we who have seen your glory revealed in our human nature, and your love made perfect in our weakness, may daily be renewed in your image, and conformed to the pattern of your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. (David Silk)\n\nIf John the Baptist helps us begin our Advent season, it is Mary who helps bring it to the end.\n\nAdvent as a season waiting, faithful, patient waiting, is a season to sit with Mary the mother of Jesus and ponder this pregnancy. Announced by the Angel Gabriel, proclaimed by Mary in her song, the Magnificat, it is a pregnancy that would bring redemption and change to the world.\n\nI think of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor who sat waiting for redemption & change to come in the midst of the Nazi terror of WW II, who said this about Mary.\n\n“Mary, filled with the Spirit and prepared. Mary, the obedient handmaid, humbly accepting what is to happen to her, what the Spirit asks of her, to do with her as the Spirit will, speaks now by the Spirit of the coming of God into the world, of the Advent of Jesus Christ. She knows better than anyone what it means to wait for Christ. He is near to her than to anyone else. She awaits him as his mother. She knows about the mystery of his coming, of the Spirit who came to her, of the Almighty God who works his wonders. She experiences in her own body that God does wonderful things with the children of men, that his ways are not our ways, that he cannot be predicted by men, or circumscribed by their reasons and ideas, but that his way is beyond all understanding of his own will.”\n\nMary in many ways helped Bonhoeffer who waited in prison for a release that was never to come. But he understood her song and the perspective of her life.\n\n“Who among us will celebrate Christmas right? Those who finally lay down all their power, honor, and prestige, all their vanity, pride, and self-will at the manger, those who stand by the lowly and let God alone be exalted, those who see in the child in the manger the glory of God precisely in this lowliness. Those who say, along with Mary, “The Lord has regarded my low estate. My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.”\n\nIt is such a perspective from prison that guided Bonhoeffer’s last years. “From a Christian point of view, a Christmas in a prison cell is no special problem. It will probably be celebrated here in this house more sincerely and with more meaning than outside where the holiday is observed in name only.”\n\nAs we sit with Mary and wait. As we ponder what God has done. As we await the glory as Bonhoeffer once did, may we know that God’s will continues to break forth all around us, if we have ears to listen and eyes to see.\n\nLet me end with a poem written by Bonhoeffer in a Nazi prison camp at Christmas, 1944.\n\nBy Benevolent Powers (Dietrich Bonhoeffer)\n\nFaithfully and quietly surrounded by benevolent powers, wonderfully guarded and consoled, - thus will I live this day with you and go forth with you into another year.\n\nStill will the past torment our hearts Still, heavy burdens of bad times depress us, Ah, Lord give our startled souls the grace for which we were created.\n\nAnd if you pass to us the heavy, the bitter cup of pain, filled to the brim, we will accept it, without trembling from your good and beloved hand.\n\nBut if you wish us to rejoice once more in this world and the brilliance of its sun then the past too we will remember and so our entire life will belong to you.\n\nWith warmth and light let flame today the candles that you have brought into our darkness. If it can be, bring us together once again! We know your light is shining in the night.\n\nWhen the silence spreads around us deeply, let us hear that full sound of the world stretching out invisibly around us; let us hear the children's praising song.\n\nWarmly protected by benevolent powers, with confidence we wait for what may come. God is with us at evening and at morning and most certainly at each new day.\n\nFriday, December 22, 2017\n\nIf I decorate my house perfectly with lovely plaid bows, strands of twinkling lights, and shiny glass balls, but do not show love to my family, I’m just another decorator.\n\nIf I slave away in the kitchen, baking dozens of Christmas cookies, preparing gourmet meals, and arranging a beautifully adorned table at mealtime, but do not show love to my family, I’m just another cook.\n\nIf I work at the soup kitchen, carol in the nursing home, and give all that I have to charity, but do not show love to my family, it profits me nothing.\n\nIf I trim the spruce with shimmering angels and crocheted snowflakes, attend a myriad of holiday parties, and sing in the choir’s cantata but do not focus on Christ, I have missed the point.\n\nLove stops the cooking to hug the child.\n\nLove sets aside the decorating to kiss the husband.\n\nLove is kind, though harried and tired.\n\nLove doesn’t envy another home that has coordinated Christmas china and table linens.\n\nLove doesn’t yell at the kids to get out of your way.\n\nLove doesn’t give only to those who are able to give in return, but rejoices in giving to those who can’t.\n\nLove bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.\n\nLove never fails. Video games will break, pearl necklaces will be lost, golf clubs will rust.\n\nSunday, December 17, 2017\n\nNarrator: The nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, based on the Gospel writings of St. Luke and St. Matthew. But before we tell the story, we need to remind ourselves:\n\nBefore the universe existed, there was God. There was no time and no space, but there was God. Then God spoke and Creation came to be. One of the things God created was freedom, which was the ability to say “yes” or “no” of your own free will and not be compelled to answer one way or the other. God yearned with all of God’s heart that the Creation God made would say “yes” to a deep relationship with God its creator. But more often than not, parts of that Creation said, “No.” People said, “No.” We said, “No.”\n\nSaying “No” to relationship with God led people down some dark paths. They ruled each other instead of serving each other in love. Fear controlled the day. And yet God did not give up. God decided to send God’s own Son into this wayward Creation to show us the path back to the God who never broke the relationship like we had done. All God needed was someone to say, “Yes.”\n\nEpilogue\n\nNarrator: And so God sent God’s only Son to teach people to use their freedom to remain open to God, to say “Yes” to that deep relationship. A few decades later, he would die for his convictions. But then he rose again to show that nothing, not even death, can separate us from God’s love.\n\nAll the Cast (on Poster board) Speak: So when you are searching for God… now that God is always with you… And when the Prince of Peace calls to you… Say “Yes!”\n\nArranged in 2013 by the Rev. Matthew Kozlowski for St. Mary’s in Stuart, FL; additional parts in 2014 by The Rev. Adam Thomas of St. Mark’s in Mystic, CT. Adapted, etc. by Rev. Kurt – 12/2015 for St. Peter's, Monroe.\n\nJesus laid out the fundamentals for any who would follow him when he said, “The first [commandment] of all is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” (Mark 12:29-31). The Beloved Community is the body within which we promote the fruits of the spirit and grow to recognize our kinship as people who love God and love the image of God that we find in our neighbors, in ourselves, and in creation. It provides a positive, theologically and biblically based ideal toward which we can grow in love, rather than framing our justice and reconciliation efforts as fundamentally “against” (as in anti-racism, anti-oppression, etc.).\n\nCharles Skinner describes the vision this way: “Beloved Community is not an organization of individuals; it is a new adventure of consecrated men and women seeking a new world … who forget themselves in their passion to find the common life where the good of all is the quest of each.” Quoting Karl Barth, Charles Marsh writes of the Beloved Community, “[T]he Christian regards the peaceable reign of God as the hidden meaning of all movements for liberation and reconciliation that ‘brings us together for these days as strangers and yet as friends.’”\n\nIn other words, Beloved Community is the practical image of the world we pray for when we say, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” We dream of communities where all people may experience dignity and abundant life, and see themselves and others as beloved children of God. We pray for communities that labor so that the flourishing of every person (and all creation) is seen as the hope of each. Conceived this way, Beloved Community provides a deeply faithful paradigm for transformation, formation, organizing, advocacy, and witness.\n\nPray the Collect for This Sunday Stir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and, because we are sorely hindered by our sins, let your bountiful grace and mercy speedily help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and glory, now and forever. Amen.\n\nReflection: Stir Us Up The Prophet Isaiah (see Isaiah 61:1-4, 8-11) envisions a holy community where all people flourish and seek the good for each other, and it all begins with the anointing of the Holy Spirit. How often do we pause in our efforts and ask God to stir, anoint, and equip us for the journey? Remember that we are always learning and practicing the way of Jesus, who blesses and teaches us to live his way of love.\n\nIn the Labyrinth: Practicing the Way of Love in the Pattern of Jesus Loving our neighbor takes formation, practice, and commitment. How will each of us learn to be reconcilers, healers, and justice-bearers in Jesus’ name? How could we practice sharing stories, growing relationship across dividing walls, and seeking Christ in the “other”?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Kingdom of God could use some demonstration plots [of the Beloved Community]. Dr. Clarence Jordan used this image in founding Koinonia Farms outside of Americus, Georgia. The idea is to carry out the Christian faith in some places in such a public way that others see the Gospel of Jesus Christ being lived out today. How might your congregation be a demonstration plot for the Kingdom of God? First, you would need to be living out the love of God as revealed in Jesus Christ in such a way as to get others thinking. Second, “demonstration plots” are created in public places so that farmers can watch the progress of the crops or methods used in the experimental garden. How might your congregation live out the Gospel in a way the neighbors will notice, not for the sake of your church so much as for the sake of the Gospel? ~ The Rev. Canon Frank Logue, Canon to the Ordinary (Episcopal Diocese of Georgia)\n\nThis was given at the 8 AM.Holy One, you have come among us to lead us in paths of righteousness. Guide our feet through the wilderness toward the living water of your grace, following in the steps of our Savior: Jesus Christ, the light of the world. Amen.\n\nThis third Sunday of Advent, John the Baptist for a second week in a row calls us to repentance. We are invited to turn away from evil, to reject the temptations of Satan and turn toward the good and the path of following Jesus. We need to hear his message once again this Advent, “at a time in our world when some flourish beyond imagining while others starve for lack of resources and love.”\n\nJohn the Baptist, as the forerunner, lives in a way that we should emulate. John the Baptist always pointed toward the one who was to come, Jesus. His message was never about him, but about Jesus. “His deeds mattered, but Jesus' deeds mattered more. His proclamation was compelling, but Jesus' proclamation was all consuming.”\n\nWhen Jesus appears on the scene, John the Baptizer immediately acknowledges the greatness of Jesus, greater than all that is past—greater than John, greater than all ancient memories and hopes. When Jesus comes into the narrative, John quickly, abruptly, without reservation says of Jesus, \"He must increase, I must decrease.\"\n\nWhat to do while we watch and wait this Advent season? Move from the large vision of Isaiah to the small discipline of John. If John embodies all that is old and Jesus embodies all that is new, take as your Advent work toward Christmas that enterprise: decrease/increase which is a form of repentance. Decrease what is old and habitual and destructive in your life, so that the new life-giving power of Jesus may grow large…\n\nFranz Jacob is a barber in a small town outside of Quebec. One of his regulars is six-year-old Wyatt Lafreniere. Wyatt is autistic - he has trouble sitting still and he's hypersensitive to being touched.\n\nSo Franz will follow Wyatt around his shop as needed. He'll crawl on the floor with Wyatt and clip the boy's hair a snip and a shear at a time. Wyatt will sometimes just lie down on the floor, so Franz will lie down on the floor, too, taking as much time as Wyatt needs.\n\nMany barbers and hairdressers don't know how to deal with clients with disabilities like autism, but Franz Jacob has several regular customers with autism, Wyatt being the youngest. He's learned how to adapt to their needs. He schedules them for the end of the day so he can take the time he needs, as long as an hour to 90 minutes. \"I lock the front door. It has to stay quiet,\" explains Franz. \"I'm just being really patient because they are [the ones] driving those moments.\"\n\nFranz Jacob also works with people who are terminally ill, who want to enjoy a last trim. \"When you shave someone who is probably going to die within 48 hours ... it's indescribable . . . I'm really proud to be doing all this,' he says.\n\nTo Wyatt's mom, Franz Jacob is a hero.\n\n\"He welcomes him like his best friend. To see that he accepts these differences is just fantastic,\" she says.\n\nA few weeks ago, Mrs. Lafreniere published a photo she took of the burly, grizzly-bearded, tattooed barber lying on the floor of his shop giving her son a haircut. The photo was posted online and in newspapers throughout Canada, and made the barber a hero - but Franz says, \"I don't see myself like that, but I'm just doing my best all the time for my community.\" [CTVnews.ca; CBC]\n\nIsn’t that what John the Baptist expects of us?\n\nIn what our Christian tradition has come to call the \"Incarnation,\" that is God with us, the God of love becomes one of us so that we might become one with God. The Incarnation is not only an event but a practice: that we \"embody\" the love of God for the sake of others.\n\nA barber in Canada becomes the \"incarnation\" of God's love when he puts aside his adult world to bend down and crawl on the floor to enter the world of his young autistic client.\n\nMay this Christmas be the beginning of our own \"practice\" of incarnation: to leave our own self-centered world to travel humbly in the world of those in need and, through our patience, understanding and generosity, to make the compassion and peace of God a reality in their lives.\n\nO God, you made us in your own image and redeemed us through Jesus your Son: Look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.– Prayer for the Human Family (Book of Common Prayer, p. 815)\n\nQ: What is the mission of the Church?A: The mission of the Church is to restore all people to unity with God and each other in Christ.\n\nQ: How does the Church pursue its mission?A: The Church pursues its mission as it prays and worships, proclaims the Gospel, and promotes justice, peace, and love.\n\nQ: Through whom does the Church carry out its mission?A: The Church carries out its mission through the ministry of all its members.– An Outline of the Faith (Book of Common Prayer, p. 855)\n\nSome reading that would be helpful (in Becoming the Beloved Community):\n\nMichelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness\n\nJim Wallis, America’s Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege and the Bridge to a New America\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\n\nJames Cone, The Cross & The Lynching Tree\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates, Between the World & Me\n\n(I am reading this right now: The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race is a 2016 essay and poetry collection edited by Jesmyn Ward)\n\nThe end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the end is the creation of the Beloved Community. It is this type of spirit and this type of love that can transform opponents into friends. ... It is this love which will bring about miracles in the hearts of men. – The Rev. Dr. Martin L. King, Jr.\n\nIn a new television interview,\nPope Francis said the common rendering of one line in the prayer —\n“lead us not into temptation” — was “not a good translation” from\nancient texts. “Do not let us fall into temptation,” he suggested, might\nbe better because God does not lead people into temptation; Satan does. (from a NY Times article)\n\nI had the opportunity to be on pilgrimage in Jerusalem, in Israel and the Palestinian Territory in 1999. It was an amazing trip and I was treated very well by all the people I met. After President Trump on his own recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, I began to think of the people there and what our response should be. I can only imagine the anguish of the Palestinian Christians who live there.\n\nToday, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced that he intends to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move that would reverse more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy. This decision could have profound ramifications on the peace process and the future of a two-state solution, and it could have a negative impact throughout the region and with key U.S. allies. The Episcopal Church Office is joining with Churches for Middle East Peace and many other organizations in opposing any effort to move the Embassy.\n\n+Archbishop Suheil Dawani, Archbishop of the Episcopal Church of Jerusalem and the Middle East, has joined with patriarchs and heads of local churches in Jerusalem in opposing this move. We support Archbishop Suheil and value his perspective and expertise. As Episcopalians and Anglicans, we reiterate our view that the final status of Jerusalem, a city important to Jews, Muslims, and Christians, needs to be negotiated by Israelis and Palestinians with the support of our nation and the international community.\n\nSunday, December 10, 2017\n\nShepherding God, guide us through this season of anticipation and hope. Comfort our troubled minds, and strengthen our tired bodies. Restore the hope this season offers, that we might lift our voices with strength and joy! Straighten the crooked paths that we might walk in your ways. Level the rocky ground that we might prepare for your arrival in our world. In Christ's name, we pray. Amen. (Ministry Matters)\n\nOur Advent season of hopeful anticipation continues with our reading from Isaiah, from which, the Gospel of Mark uses a few lines to describe John the Baptist this morning.\n\n“See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way; the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight…”\n\nPrepare the way of the Lord. That is what the season of Advent is for us. To prepare ourselves for God who is coming. John the Baptist is here to shake things up. To remind us that things are not the way God wants them. To repent. To fix. To make things straight.\n\nBut Isaiah, starts us not with repentance but comfort: “Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem…” So we begin with comfort...\n\n(On Twitter) “After 20-year-old Chris Betancourt's cancer came back and was given a year to live, his best friend dropped out of college to help him fulfill his bucket list. This day, they crossed off feeding the homeless.” (ABCNews)\n\nThe little clip was a piece of an amazing story filled with comfort even with death staring at that young man, who isn’t ready to stop yet. And Isaiah doesn’t stop with comfort, the announcement of God with God’s people. Think of what Isaiah is saying to us:\n\nGod’s glory will then be complete And the world will see it Just as God has said — from the archives of the Church of Scotland (This is your God, slightly adapted)\n\nBut for God to do this, to bring comfort, to bring salvation, to bring hope in the midst of darkness, we must take our part in God’s plan. How will we make the crooked road straight? (and in Monroe!)\n\nLet me tell you about Daryl Davis. He is a southern blues musician. He is African American who has an interesting hobby. He collects Ku Klux Klan robes. He's got about 200 of them. How he gets them is the story…\n\nDavis got his first robe 30 years ago while playing in a bar in Frederick, Maryland. After his set, a white gentleman approached him. \"I really enjoy your all's music,\" he said. \"You know this is the first time I ever heard a black man play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.\" Davis thanked him and then asked, \"Where do you think Jerry Lee Lewis learned how to play that kind of style?\" And then the musician explained the roots of rock 'n roll in the black blues tradition, that the rockabilly style he liked was not invented by Jerry Lee Lewis but developed by black artists like Fats Domino and Little Richard.\n\nThe two talked for some time. As the conversation went on, the man said, \"You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black man.'\" He then said he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Davis laughed at first, not believing him - but he man pulled out pictures and produced his Klan card. Davis immediately stopped laughing. But the man was very friendly and asked Davis to call him the next time he played at the bar.\n\n\"The fact that a Klansman and black person could sit down at the same table and enjoy the same music, that was a seed planted,\" Davis recalls. \"So what do you do when you plant a seed? You nourish it.\"\n\nDavis decided to go around the country and meet and talk to as many Klan members as he could - music always being the entrée. First he learned all he could about the Klan to understand what they really think - that enabled Davis to sit down and talk with people who instinctively hated him. Davis deflated the racial stereotypes that fueled their anger and hatred. \"How can you hate me when you don't know me?\" he asks.\n\n\"If you spend five minutes with your worst enemy - it doesn't have to be about race, it could be about anything . . . you will find that you both have something in common. As you build upon those commonalities, you're forming a relationship and as you build upon that relationship, you're forming a friendship. That's what would happen. I didn't convert anybody. They saw the light and converted themselves.\"\n\nOnce the friendship and trust blossom, the Klansmen realize that their hate may be misguided. When they renounce their membership, Davis collects the robes and keeps them in his home as a reminder of the dent he has made in racism by simply sitting down and having dinner with people & sharing a love for music.\n\nDaryl Davis has been having those conversations for three decades now. And he has their robes as testimonies. [NPR, August 20, 2017.]\n\nA blues musician reduces the ranks of the Ku Klux Klan by his message of music and kindness; he straightens a very crooked path by his courage to sit down and talk with those who see him as beneath them, whose reaction from them is to see him destroyed. Daryl Davis is a prophet in the spirit of John the Baptist. In baptism, each one of us has been called by God to the work of prophet: using whatever talents and skills we possess to transform the wastelands around us into harvests of justice and forgiveness, to create highways for our God to enter and re-create our world in his compassion and peace.\n\nMay we hear Isaiah’s call in the lives of the prophets and in our lives too, to change all that is crooked, broken, uneven, so God can bring comfort, hope, and love in our world.

[NPR, August 20, 2017.]\n\nReflection: Proclaim Good News\n\nGod sent John the Baptist to proclaim the good news that we could repent, be forgiven, and return to God’s dream of restoration and salvation. John didn’t just cry out in the wilderness; he prepared people to enter the waters of baptism, to share their deepest truths, and to rise up ready for healed and reconciled relationship with God and with their neighbors.\n\nProclaiming the Dream of Beloved Community\n\nHealing, reconciliation, and justice are big ideas, but they all begin with exploring our stories, shared history, and deepest longings. If you listened closely to your church and your neighbors and civic partners, what might you hear? What experiences have people had around race, ethnicity and culture? Is there a shared vision of Beloved Community? What collective commitments and behaviors could you all make that would begin to foster the Beloved Community?\n\nThe 1979 prayer book restores the most ancient name for this tradition\non making Eucharist: the Great Thanksgiving. there are four primary\nactions within the Great Thanksgiving, and these are based on the\nactions of Jesus in the Last Supper as well as on the Jewish pattern of\nthanksgiving suppers: we offer bread and wine, we bless them, we break\nthe bread, and we give the bread and wine to all who have gathered. In\nthe church's vocabulary, these four actions of offering, blessing,\nbreaking, and giving are called the offertory, consecration, fraction,\nand communion.\n\nIn the Episcopal Church today we receive\ncommunion in a variety of ways. In some congregations you will go\nforward to the altar and kneel at an altar rail. In others, you may\nstand and receive in front of the altar or at various communion stations\nlocated throughout the church.\n\nSome people receive by eating\nbread first and then drinking directly from the cup; others prefer to\ndid the wafer or morsel of bread into the wine and then consume the\nbread and wine together-a process known as intinction, or to receive\njust the bread. (Gluten Free wafers are often available.)\n\nSource: Vicki K. Black, Welcome to the Book of Common Prayer. Morehouse Publishing: Harrisburg, PA, 2005, pp.53, 56, 57.\nFrom time to time, people have asked me about our use of the common cup and if it transmits colds, etc. Here are articles on this...Holy Communion and Infection Risks: an Age-Old Concern (1999)\n\n\"It must be stressed that the present use of the common cup is normal for Anglican churches, follows\nthe practice of the universal church from its beginnings until well\ninto the middle ages, and poses no real hazard to health in normal\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"No\nepisode of disease attributable to the common cup has ever been\nreported. Thus for the average communicant it would seem that the risk\nof drinking from the common cup is probably less than the risk of\nair-borne infection in using a common building.\"\n\n\"A\nmicrobiologist shows, through scientific studies, that\nreceiving Holy Communion does not increase one's illness rate\nwhen compared to the general population which does not take\ncommunion.\"My suggestion:If you have the flu, a\ncold, or a cold sore, then don’t drink from the cup. I would suggest\nwashing your hands before communion (or using the hand sanitizer) and just receiving the wafer alone.\n\nSunday, December 3, 2017\n\nO God of salvation, you sent your Son Jesus to be among us, but we have been little aware of his presence. Wake us up to see him all around us, that he may be the light of our lives and that we may be part of his kingdom of peace and love where we serve you in one another, as we move forward in hope to your home of endless joy and rest. We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nBy the time we got to the last pile of leaves here on Friday, the sunset had long vanished, we were working by the light of the parking lot lights. Such is the darkness that we experience as our days continue to grow shorter and shorter.\n\nBut for many of us, the darkness of our lives is experienced every day, whether it is the darkness that comes with depression and the feeling of hopelessness, or with addiction & a feeling of powerlessness. Whether it is the darkness of feeling that we don’t have enough as we live pay check to pay check… We can feel that we are far too often running on one of those hamster wheels that we can never get off.\n\nJesus said that in our lives, there will be darkness, but he calls us to stay alert, keep awake for the sign of God, our master, in our midst… and maybe we need a little help.\n\nThere is a 30-second ad for Home Goods, a little boy is going through the \"monsters under the bed\" anxiety stage. Each night at bedtime, his understanding parents patiently check for monsters behind the closet door, under his bed, in the dresser. And to further assure him that he has nothing to be afraid of, they place a special lamp, with a friendly whale at the base, to keep him company at night as he falls asleep. The whale lamp works like a charm.\n\nWell, the little boy soon becomes a big brother. And the first night his new baby sister comes home, he gives his little sister his first big-brother gift: his friendly blue whale lamp to keep her company as she falls asleep, and then he goes through all the doors of the nursery and searches under the baby's crib himself to make sure there are no monsters lurking.\n\nThis charming little commercial is about the patience to help one another through life's scary passages, selflessness to walk together in hard times; I think of those who have gone through the long, dark road of addiction, and who on the other side become sponsors to help those navigating the darkness now.\n\nJesus said, “Therefore, keep awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn, or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.”\n\nSuch words from Jesus are not about the scary darkness, but about the life we live now in the midst of it, to keep watch for the presence of hope, life and goodness that is all around us, and to help one another.\n\nAn honor student, frustrated with his life and with school, worried about what tomorrow may bring, approached his teacher asking for some guidance.\n\n“The story goes,” says the teacher in response to his students request for help, “That a Buddhist Monk was walking through the mountains one day. Then, out of nowhere, a tiger appears, chasing the monk towards the edge of a cliff. The monk, in his quest to escape the tiger, runs to the edge of the cliff and climbs over the side, where he sees five other tigers 15 feet below him, waiting to eat him.\n\nSo the monk is just hanging there, holding on to a vine on the side of the cliff, waiting there for the little chance he has to escape or for his imminent demise. Then, as the monk hangs there, exploring his options, he turns to the left and sees a strawberry. He smiles, “Wow what a magnificent strawberry!” he says to himself. So, he picks it and he eats it.\n\nThe student waited for his teacher to continue but it was clear that the teacher was done with the story. “That’s it? That’s the story? The monk is about to be eaten by tigers so he reaches out to pick and eat a strawberry?” the student exclaimed. “What’s the point?” he added.\n\nThe teacher replied, “The lesson is to know and embrace the experience of being alive. You must be alive every second you are alive.”\n\nThe student responded, “But teacher, everyone is alive when they are alive.”\n\n“No,” said the teacher. “It’s the experience of being alive in each moment, in each experience, good and bad. We must be alive every second we are alive and not simply exist and live out our days.”\n\n“No. Look at you now,” explained the teacher. “You are running around being chased by tigers, consumed with your thoughts of how it could be better, how you could be better if only things were different. You can’t be alive if you are living in fear and if you’re living in fear you can’t see and experience life; the magnificence of your life that is right in front of you in each moment.”\n\nThe teacher asked, “Are you running around, grinning over the feeling of being the luckiest, most fortunate and appreciative person in the world because of what IS present in your life today, or are you consumed with fear, what you DON’T have in your life or what may possibly happen sometime in the future?” The student thought for a moment, looked up at his teacher, smiled, and continued on with his day…” (adapted from a Zen story retold by D.T. Suzuki)\n\nJesus said, “And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.”\n\nJesus calls us to the same challenge: to pay attention, to watch for the signs of God's presence in our midst, to be awake to the most important and lasting things of life. Our lives are an Advent in which we come to realize that our time is precious and limited, that our lives constantly change and turn and are transformed - whether we are ready or not, whether we comprehend what is happening or are overwhelmed by it. Advent calls us to \"watch,\" to pay attention to the signs of God's unmistakable presence in our lives, to live life expectantly and gratefully as a gift from God, like the monk finding that strawberry.\n\nPastor & author Richard Rohr writes that faith and spirituality begin with \"seeing. It's not about earning or achieving but about \"paying attention\": paying attention to the presence of God in every joy and sorrow, in every pain and trauma, in every victory and setback before us.” Advent calls us to \"watch,\" to be \"alert\", to be mindful of the presence of God all around us, in the love of family and friends & even strangers, in the best and worst of times, and to find the true meaning and purpose of our lives in moments of compassion, forgiveness and generosity that we extend to ourselves and each other. Amen.\n\nSaturday, December 2, 2017\n\nIn the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God ... Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together. - Isaiah 40:3,5\n\nAdvent is a season of preparation: shopping for gifts, decorating our homes and sanctuaries. Advent is also a time to prepare our hearts and communities for the coming of Christ, the Almighty God who came among us poor and homeless, a stranger and a child. There may be no better time to reflect on how we as the Episcopal Church embrace the Holy One who continues to draw near in the neighbor, the stranger, the refugee, or the one who seems most “other” to you. It is the ideal season to commit to becoming Beloved Community and growing loving, liberating, life-giving relationships across the human family of God.\n\n“During Advent, Christians focus on how much we need Jesus to bear light, healing and hope in a broken world,” noted the Rev. Canon Stephanie Spellers, the Presiding Bishop’s Canon for Evangelism, Reconciliation and Creation Care. “This is a mysterious, vulnerable time. We’re opening to Christ. We’re opening to different neighbors and strangers who are Christ among us.”\n\nPresiding Bishop Michael Curry regularly welcomes us to live not just as the church but as the Episcopal branch of the Jesus Movement: the ongoing community that follows Jesus into loving, liberating, life-giving relationship with God, each other, and creation. May God bless and grow us into vibrant embodiments of the Christ we welcome and follow, this Advent and always.\n\nAs we enter Advent together, consider these prayers and what they might ask of each of us…\n\nAlmighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen. (Collect for the 1st Sunday in Advent)\n\nLook with pity, O heavenly Father, upon the people in this land who live with injustice, terror, disease, and death as their constant companions. Have mercy upon us. Help us to eliminate our cruelty to these our neighbors. Strengthen those who spend their lives establishing equal protection of the law and equal opportunities for all. And grant that every one of us may enjoy a fair portion of the riches of this land; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. (Collect for the Oppressed)\n\nWe cannot become what God created us to be unless we also examine who we have been and who we are today. Who are you, as a church community? What groups are included and excluded? What things have you, as a church, done and left undone?\n\nGiven at the 8 AM service. Open my eyes that they may see the deepest needs of people; Move my hands that they may feed the hungry; Touch my heart that it may bring warmth to the despairing; Teach me the generosity that welcomes strangers; Let me share my possessions to clothe the naked; Give me the care that strengthens the sick; Make me share in the quest to set the prisoner free. In sharing our anxieties and our love, our poverty and our prosperity, we partake of your divine presence, O Lord. Amen. (Canaan Banana, Zimbabwe)\n\nThat prayer came from Zimbabwe, and it is good for us to remember in prayer those throughout our world who are enduing great suffering like in the Egyptian bombing at a sufi mosque there, and those who are waking up to a new dawn full of hope and freedom like in Zimbabwe.\n\nOne of Norah’s books we read to her at night says something like this: “The geese and the donkey, the sheep and the goats, were making funny noises down in their throats.” On the farm, they are all together.\n\nBut in today’s Gospel parable – Jesus tells us about a King who separates people, as if he were separating sheep from goats, it is a stunning parable if we sit with it…\n\nThis concluding parable of Matthew 25, the final teaching of Jesus in the Gospel, shows Christ as a king separating the people of the nations but neither the sheep or goats thought they were either serving or rejecting their heavenly king. What both the sheep and the goats failed to see were the vulnerable people who were starving or naked or in prison. “This teaching has inspired a spirituality of “seeing” Jesus in vulnerable people, the rejects of society, & what is at stake is seeing the people, seeing their need, and showing one has seen them by serving them.” (Abbott Andrew)\n\nBut as we sit with this parable, we also have sit with the ending; the separation, the judgement…\n\n“Edifying as this teaching of serving Christ through serving vulnerable people is, the grim sending away of the “goats” at the end of the parable, those who failed to serve the vulnerable is disturbing. One way to understand this grim ending is to suggest that if our hearts shrink to the vanishing point so that we become permanently blind to the plight of vulnerable people, we end up in our own darkness. This is a salutary warning. But perhaps these “goats,” need to be served too...” (Abbott Andrew)\n\nIndeed, we are not Jesus. We are his disciples and he calls us to love and care for those in need, the sheep and the goats, the vulnerable, the lost, even the hard hearted…But what does this look like?\n\nProtestant author, professor & therapist Richard Beck searched for an answer until he came across the teaching of the “Little Way” in the writings of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. “Beck says that this “little way” seems simple until one tries it. The “little way” begins with noticing. Thérèse says that she noticed that some sisters in her Carmelite convent were saintly and popular and other sisters were difficult and ignored as much as possible: a separation of sheep and goats. Thérèse then had to move beyond her comfort zone and seek out the neglected, difficult sisters.” (Abbott Andrew)\n\nI have noticed (and this is very natural) that the most saintly Sisters are the most loved. We seek their company; we render them services without their asking; finally, these souls so capable of bearing the lack of respect and consideration of others see themselves surrounded with everyone's affection...\n\nOn the other hand, imperfect souls are not sought out. No doubt we remain within the limits of religious politeness in their regard, but we generally avoid them, fearing lest we say something which isn't too amiable. When I speak of imperfect souls, I don't want to speak of spiritual imperfections since most holy souls will be perfect in heaven; but I want to speak of a lack of judgment, good manners, touchiness in certain characters; all these things which don't make life agreeable. I know very well that these moral infirmities are chronic, that there is no hope of a cure, but I also know that my Mother would not cease to take care of me, to try to console me, if I remained sick all my life. This is the conclusion I draw from this: I must seek out in recreation, on free days, the company of Sisters who are the least agreeable to me in order to carry out with regard to these wounded souls the office of the Good Samaritan. A word, an amiable smile, often suffice to make a sad soul bloom...I want to be friendly with everybody (and especially with the least amiable Sisters) to give joy to Jesus. (St, Therese of Liseuix)\n\nBeck ends by saying “I must seek out. That's the practice of the “Little Way.” Seeking out, approaching and moving toward people you might not have normally approached, for whatever reason. All with the goal of extending a small act of welcome and hospitality, a kind word or a smile.”\n\nSuch kindness, hospitality, love is what we can offer to everyone, but how far do we go?\n\nYou're scrolling through the news or thumbing through the paper and you come across a story about a kid who overdosed or was bullied to the point of such despair that the kid took his or her own life. You might shrug for a second, shake your head, sigh that this is just another case of [name your reason].\" Or, you might not even notice the story at all as you move on to the business section or the sports page.\n\nBut if that kid lived in your state or city or town, you'd notice. Hey, this kind of thing just doesn't happen here! You'd demand accountability; you'd want to know what's being done to help kids like this.\n\nNow if the kid went to the same school as your son or daughter, you'd immediately join other parents in asking some hard questions of school and law enforcement officials. If the kid lived next door to you, you'd be right there for that family. It would be as if your child had died. And if it was your own son or daughter . . . That fact is: It is our own kid. Every kid is our kid.\n\nHarvard Professor of Public Policy Dr. Robert Putnam, author of Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis, writes: \"Our sense of 'we' has shriveled. Now when people talk about 'our kids,' they talk about their own biological kids; they don't talk about all kids. This leads to a situation that's bad for the economy & bad for democracy. But it's just not right. We have an obligation to care for other people's kids too.\"\n\nWhich is Jesus' point in today's Gospel parable: Every kid is our kid. We are our brother’s keeper, sheep or goat. Every person in trouble is our responsibility. Every injustice endured by another is our responsibility. Because every kid, every person in trouble, every innocent is Jesus to us. To be a disciple of Christ is to possess the vision & heart of God that enables us to see the goodness and image of God in every human being, we are all on this beautiful planet together. Our care for the poor, our work to alleviate despair and injustice in our communities, our holding ourselves accountable for creating more opportunities for the under-educated and under-employed is our first and most meaningful response to our baptismal call to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom in Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we practice the Little Way with all, the agreeable and not so agreeable, with every kid, with every sheep and goat before us, so Jesus may say to us, “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.” Amen.\n\nWednesday, November 22, 2017\n\nLoving God, all that we have\ncomes from your goodness\nand the work of those who love us.\nBless us and the food we share.\nWatch over those who care for us.\nOpen our eyes to the needs of the poor\nduring this time of harvest and thanksgiving.\nWe ask this through Christ our Lord.

{"text": "Concentration in the Greek private hospital sector: a descriptive analysis.\nOver the last 20 years, governments all around the world have attempted to boost the role of market and competition in health care industries in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The increased competition and the significant implications on costs and prices of health care services resulted in health care industries being transformed. Large firms are merging and acquiring other firms. If this trend continues, few firms will dominate the health care markets. In this study, I use the simple concentration ratio (CR) for the largest 4, 8 and 20 companies to measure the concentration of Greek private hospitals during the period 1997-2004. Also, the Gini coefficient for inequality is used. For the two different categories of hospitals used (a) general and neuropsychiatric and (b) obstetric/gynaecological it is evident that the top four firms of the first category accounted for 43% of sales in 1997, and 52% in 2004, while the four largest firms of the second category accounted for almost 83% in 1997, and 81% in 2004. Also, the Gini coefficient increases over the 8-year period examined from 0.69 in 1997 to 0.82 in 2004. It explains that the market of the private health care services becomes less equal in the sense that fewer private hospitals and clinics hold more and more of the share of the total sales. From a cross-industry analysis it is clear that the private hospital sector has the highest concentration rate. Finally, it appears that the market structure of the private hospitals in Greece resembles more closely to an oligopoly rather than a monopolistic competition, since very few firms dominate the market.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Q:\n\nHow to count each item in array with sql\n\nI have a user table which contain a membergroupids, and user table looks like this: \nuserid   membergroupids\n1        1,2\n2        2,3\n3        2,3,4\n\nand I want to use sql to output a result like this \nmembergroupid    count\n1                1\n2                3\n3                2\n4                1\n\nI tried use SELECT membergroupids FROM user, then use php to loop through the result and get the count, but it works with small set of user table, but I have a really big user table, the select query itself will take more than 1min to finish, is there better way to do this? \n\nA:\n\nThere is a much better way to do it. Your tables need to be normalized:\nInstead of\nuserid   membergroupids\n1        1,2\n2        2,3\n3        2,3,4\n\nIt needs to be\nuserid   membergroupids\n1        1\n1        2\n2        2\n2        3\n3        2\n3        3\n3        4\n\nFrom here, it's a simple query to get the counts (assuming this table is called your_table:\nselect count(membergroupids) as numberofgroups, userid \nfrom your_table \ngroup by userid \norder by userid\n\nThe real problem, then, is getting your tables normalized.  If you only have 9 membergroupids, then you could use a like '%1%' to find all userids with membergroupid #1.  But if you have 10, then it won't be able to distinguish between 1 and 10.  And sadly, you can't count on the commas to help you distinguish because the number might not be surrounded by commas.\nunless...\nCreate new field with group ids encapsulated by commas\nyou could create a new field and populate it with membergroupids and surround it with commas by using concat (check your database's docs). Something along this line:\nupdate your_table set temp=concat(',', membergroupids, ',');\n\nThis could give you a table structure like so:\nuserid   membergroupids  temp\n1        1,2             ,1,2,\n2        2,3             ,2,3,\n3        2,3,4           ,2,3,4,\n\nNow, you have the ability to grab distinct member group ids in the new field, ie, where temp like '%,1,%' to find userids with membergroupid 1. (They will be encapsulated by commas) Now, you can manually build your new normalized table which I'll call user_member.\nInsert membergroupid 1:\ninsert into user_member (userid,membergroupid) select userid,'1' from your_table where temp like '%,1,%';\n\nYou could make a php script that loops through all the membergroupids.\nKeep in mind that like %...% is not very efficient, so don't even think about relying on this to do your count.  It'll work, but it's not scalable. It would be much better to use this to build the normalized table.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Evaluating mitochondrial autophagy in the mouse heart.\nMitochondrial autophagy plays an important role in mediating mitochondrial quality control. Evaluating the extent of mitochondrial autophagy is challenging in the adult heart in vivo. Keima is a fluorescent protein that emits different colored signals at acidic and neutral pHs. Keima targeted to mitochondria (Mito-Keima) is useful in evaluating the extent of mitochondrial autophagy in cardiomyocytes in vitro. In order to evaluate the level of mitochondrial autophagy in the heart in vivo, we generated adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 harboring either Mito-Keima or Lamp1-YFP. AAV9-Mito-Keima and AAV9-Lamp1-YFP were administered intravenously and mice were subjected to either forty-eight hours of fasting or normal chow. Thin slices of the heart prepared within cold PBS were subjected to confocal microscopic analyses. The acidic dots Mito-Keima elicited by 561nm excitation were co-localized with Lamp1-YFP dots (Pearson's correlation, 0.760, p<0.001), confirming that the acidic dots of Mito-Keima were localized in lysosomes. The area co-occupied by Mito-Keima puncta with 561nm excitation and Lamp1-YFP was significantly greater 48h after fasting. Electron microscopic analyses indicated that autophagosomes containing only mitochondria were observed in the heart after fasting. The mitochondrial DNA content and the level of COX1/GAPDH, indicators of mitochondrial mass, were significantly smaller in the fasting group than in the control group, consistent with the notion that lysosomal degradation of mitochondria is stimulated after fasting. In summary, the level of mitochondrial autophagy in the adult heart can be evaluated with intravenous injection of AAV-Mito-Keima and AAV-Lamp1-YFP and confocal microscopic analyses.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "This invention relates to ceramics and more particularly to aluminosilicate ceramics.\nCeramics based on monoclinic celsian (BaO.Al.sub.2 O.sub.3.2SiO.sub.2) can be considered for applications requiring materials with a combination of high melting point, low thermal expansion, high thermal shock resistance, high-frequency working capabilities, low and thermally stable dielectric constant and low loss tangent. For example, celsian is a promising candidate for use as thermally-stable dielectric and refractory materials. Celsian ceramics have been reported in the literature as having a thermal expansion of 2.5 x 10.sup.-6 /degree (at 20.degree.-1000.degree. C.), bending strength up to 110 MPa, dielectric constant and loss tangent of 6-7 and (1-2) x 10.sup.-4, respectively, at 20.degree. C. and 1 MHz, and dielectric constant stable up to 600.degree. C. These ceramics were prepared from natural (kaolin or clay) or technical grade purity starting materials containing significant amounts of impurities which can adversely affect all properties, particularly the dielectric behavior of ceramics especially at high temperatures.\nCelsian with melting point of about 1760.degree. C. exists in two main crystalline modifications: monoclinic, stable up to 1590.degree. C., and hexagonal, stable from 1590.degree. C. to melting temperature. Although the hexagonal modification is stable at temperatures above 1590.degree. C., it tends to be the first product of solid phase reaction and has a strong tendency to persist metastably in the whole temperature range. Hexagonal celsian transforms reversibly into low temperature orthorhombic form at 300.degree. C. This transformation is accompanied by significant volume changes. Because of this fact, hexagonal celsian is of no practical use as ceramic materials for high-temperature, especially, thermal cycling applications. Properties of celsian ceramics mentioned above belong to monoclinic modification. Literature reveals that the transformation of hexagonal celsian into the monoclinic form is promoted by prolonged high-temperature (above 1450.degree. C.) heating, hydrothermal treatment at about 2 kbar pressure, formation of glass phase during firing, and by the presence of impurities or the addition of certain additives (such as B.sub.2 O.sub.3, LiF, Cr.sub.2 O.sub.3, CaF.sub.2, ZrSiO.sub.3). However, the preparation of monoclinic celsian from high-purity raw materials free of undesirable additives by conventional processes can be only accomplished by long term high temperature treatment.\nIt would be desirable to provide a method of making pure monoclinic celsian at lower temperatures for shorter heating times without the use of contaminating additives.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Growth hormone modulates cholecalciferol metabolism with moderate effects on intestinal mineral absorption and specific effects on bone formation in growing dogs raised on balanced food.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the influence of growth hormone (GH) on Vitamin D3 metabolism and the subsequent effects on calcium (Ca) homeostasis and skeletal growth in growing dogs. A group of Miniature Poodles received supraphysiological doses of GH (GH group; n = 6; 0.5 IU GH per kg body per day) from 12 to 21 weeks of age and was compared with a control placebo-treated group (n = 8). Biologic activity of GH in the GH compared to the control group was indicated by (a) the 2.5- to 3.5-fold increase in the plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), (b) the increased production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol as indicated by the significantly increased plasma 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentrations and the 12.9-fold increase in renal 1alpha-hydroxylase gene expression, and (c) the inhibited production of 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol as indicated by the significantly lower plasma 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentrations and the similar levels of renal 24-hydroxylase gene expression. Despite the distinct effects on Vitamin D(3) metabolism in the GH group, there were only moderate effects on the intestine, i.e. at 20 weeks of age there was a significant increase of 14.4 and 5.6% in fractional absorption of Ca and phosphate (Pi), respectively, compared to the control group. GH administration resulted in significantly elevated glomerular filtration rate, with no differences in Pi urine excretion as a result of a concomitant increase in the tubular reabsorption of Pi.

{"text": "Q:\n\nHow to programatically make RelativeLayout that works\n\nI have a problem with creating a working Layout in View class that will not crush the program. I think everything is done correctly in the code, but probably there are some setting I don't know about I hope that You guys will reveal that to me.\nI am trying to do drawing View with a \"Clear\" button and RadioGroup.\nSo first od all, that works fine, but both added content Views (btnReset = \"Clear\", btnScale = RadioGroup) are hoovered on each other. That is why I want to add one parent Layout, so I can easily manage these Views.\nFile1.java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     \n    DrawView tv = new DrawView(this);\n    setContentView(tv);\n    addContentView(tv.btnReset, tv.params);\n    addContentView(tv.btnScale, tv.paramsRadio);}\n\nDrawView.java\npublic class DrawView extends View {\n\n    public Button btnReset;\n    public RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params;\n    public RelativeLayout.LayoutParams paramsRadio;\n    public RadioGroup btnScale;\n\n public DrawView(Context context) {\n            super(context);\n\n    btnReset = new Button(context);\n    btnReset.setText(\"Clear Screen\");\n\n    btnScale = new RadioGroup(context);\n    btnScale.setOrientation(RadioGroup.HORIZONTAL);\n\n    params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n    RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n   paramsRadio = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n   RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\nI omit most of the code because I think its irrelevant, everything works fine but the layout.\nAnyway, when I try to create a layout, I simply add a little code:\nChanged File1.java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     \n    DrawView tv = new DrawView(this);\n    setContentView(tv);\n    addContentView(tv.layout, tv.params); }\n\nChanged DrawView.java\npublic class DrawView extends View {\n    public Button btnReset;\n    public RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params;\n    public RelativeLayout.LayoutParams paramsRadio;\n    public RelativeLayout layout;\n    public RadioGroup btnScale;\n\n public DrawView(Context context) {\n            super(context);\n\n    btnReset = new Button(context);\n    btnReset.setText(\"Clear Screen\");\n\n    btnScale = new RadioGroup(context);\n    btnScale.setOrientation(RadioGroup.HORIZONTAL);\n\n    params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n    RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n   paramsRadio = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n   RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n   layout.addView(btnReset, params);\n   layout.addView(btnScale, paramsRadio);\n\nI assume that should work like charm, but unfortunately, when I try to do anything with newly created layout, my app crashes. What is wrong with that code?\n\nA:\n\nWell, after quite long fight I managed to solve my own problem :D I did not do it, like @pskink suggested, because honestly for me it was too advanced. I found much simpler solution.\nThe thing is, You can create as much views as You want in DrawView.java, but sort them in Layout created in File1.java!\nJust like that: \nFile1.java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);     \n     LinearLayout ll = new LinearLayout(this);\n     ll.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);  \n     DrawView tv = new DrawView(this);\n     ll.addView(tv.btnReset, tv.params);\n     ll.addView(tv.btnScale, tv.paramsRadio);\n     ll.addView(tv);\n     setContentView(ll);\n\nAnd DrawView.java stays the same:\n public class DrawView extends View {\n\n    public Button btnReset;\n    public LinearLayout.LayoutParams params;\n    public LinearLayout.LayoutParams paramsRadio;\n    public RadioGroup btnScale;\n\n public DrawView(Context context) {\n            super(context);\n\n    btnReset = new Button(context);\n    btnReset.setText(\"Clear Screen\");\n\n    btnScale = new RadioGroup(context);\n    btnScale.setOrientation(RadioGroup.HORIZONTAL);\n\n    params = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n    LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n   paramsRadio = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n   LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor memory device incorporating a test circuit, and a method of operation thereof.\nA semiconductor memory device comprises of millions of memory cells tightly packed in an array on a semiconductor substrate. To ensure the quality of a memory device, various tests must be conducted on the memory cells in order to detect defective products prior to their shipments. Because the number of memory cells within a device is enormous, a preliminary test is typically performed on all memory cells to determine whether any cell is defective. If all of the memory cells pass the preliminary test, then no further tests need to be conducted. For example, a current leakage test is conducted on all cells, and if no usual leakage current is detected, then there is no need to test the memory cells individually for leakage current. But if a large leakage current is detected, it may indicate that the memory device has at least one defective cell. Further tests are required to determine which memory cell is defective and whether it can be cured.\nA test circuit that implements such preliminary testing may include a first test pad connected to all word lines and a second test pad connected to all bit lines. By applying test signals to the first and second test pad, all of the memory cells can be tested at the same time. Typically, the test circuits are built in the scribe line of the wafer. Such test structure can measure the electrical characteristics of memory cells to determine if the device is defective, but because the same signal is applied to all the cells, interference between neighboring cells cannot be detected.\nThe present invention is directed to an improved testing structure so that different groups of memory cells can be tested, and defects related to interaction between neighboring memory cells can be detected, thus allowing improvement of manufacturing process in an efficient manner.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The cellular and genomic response of an immortalized microglia cell line (BV2) to concentrated ambient particulate matter.\nAmbient particulate matter (PM) damages pulmonary tissue through oxidative stress (OS) pathways. Several reports indicate that the brain is another affected target of PM exposure. Since microglia (brain macrophages) are critical to OS-mediated neurodegeneration, the cellular and genomic response of immortalized mouse microglia (BV2) was examined in response to fine (<or= 2.5 microm) concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) collected from Tuxedo, NY. Samples of CAPs were labeled as high potency (HP) or low potency (LP) depending on their stimulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activity in human bronchial epithelial cells. Compositional analysis of these samples, performed during their original collection, indicated a strong correlation between HP CAPs and and the presence of nickel and vanadium (Maciejczyk & Chen, 2005). Exposure of the BV2 microglia to LP CAPs reduced intracellular levels of ATP (>or= 250 microg/ml) and depolarized mitochondrial membranes (>or= 6 microg/ml) within 15 min of exposure. HP and LP CAPs (>or= 25 microg/ml) differentially affected the endogenous scavengers, glutathione and nonprotein sulfhydryl in BV2 microglia after 1.5 h of exposure. Both HP and LP CAPs stimulated the release of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 after 6 h of exposures. Microarray analysis of BV2 microglia exposed to either HP or LP CAPs (75 microg/ml, 4 h) identified 3200 (HP CAPs) and 160 (LP CAPs) differentially expressed (up- and downregulated) genes relative to media controls. Of the 3200 genes significantly affected by HP CAPs, the most prominent upregulated gene probes related to inflammatory pathways associated with Toll-like receptor signaling, MAPK signaling, T- and B-cell receptor signaling, apoptosis, and various proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors. LP CAPs significantly affected 160 genes that related to pathways associated with cellular maintenance and division, cell cycling and nuclear events. These data suggest that HP CAPs, which contained higher levels of nickel and vanadium than LP CAPs, appear to be more inflammatory and selectively upregulated the expression of inflammatory and innate immunity pathways in BV2 microglia.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Twenty-year trends in fatal injuries to very young children: the persistence of racial disparities.\nMortality trends across modifiable injury mechanisms may reflect how well effective injury prevention efforts are penetrating high-risk populations. This study examined all-cause, unintentional, and intentional injury-related mortality in children who were aged 0 to 4 years for evidence of and to quantify racial disparities by injury mechanism. Injury analyses used national vital statistics data from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2003, that were available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rate calculations and chi2 test for trends (Mantel extension) used data that were collapsed into 3-year intervals to produce cell sizes with stable estimates. Percentage change for mortality rate ratios used the earliest (1981-1983) and the latest (2001-2003) study period for black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander children, with white children as the comparison group. All-cause injury rates declined during the study period, but current mortality ratios for all-cause injury remained higher in black and American Indian/Alaskan Native children and lower in Asian/Pacific Islander children compared with white children. Trend analyses within racial groups demonstrate significant improvements in all groups for unintentional but not intentional injury. Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native children had higher injury risk as a result of residential fire, suffocation, poisoning, falls, motor vehicle traffic, and firearms. Disparities narrowed for residential fire, pedestrian, and poisoning and widened for motor vehicle occupant, unspecified motor vehicle, and suffocation for black and American Indian/Alaskan Native children. These findings identify injury areas in which disparities narrowed, improvement occurred with maintenance or widening of disparities, and little or no progress was evident. This study further suggests specific mechanisms whereby new strategies and approaches to address areas that are recalcitrant to improvement in absolute rates and/or narrowing of disparities are needed and where increased dissemination of proven efficacious injury prevention efforts to high-risk populations are indicated.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Character defects and other shortcomings block or handicap our capacity to create new humane relationships among all peoples of all lands based upon pure love, mutual respect and common understanding. These character defects include the arrogance of false pride, selfish greed, lazy sloth, insecure jealousy, obese gluttony, sexist lust and hateful wrath. The ideal here is that we must seek inner liberation as humane beings, heal ourselves within, cure our character defects and work together to create an outer liberation in the world. Seek balance and harmony.\n\nThe world today is in great turmoil in different regions around the globe. We cannot pretend to be blind, deaf and dumb to what is going on. There are great stirrings in the global mass consciousness that advocate for Global Revolution as a long-range general solution for our collective global ills. We now live in a global society. We are all connected by our common survival interests, advanced technology and global communication systems.\n\nA central question is what kind of a Global Revolution should we strive for together? Humane beings need to understand that mere surface reforms of corrupt systems of government and dysfunctional economic systems will not suffice. We should continue to strive for realistic reforms, the fascist authoritarian system can correct itself to a set point, but ultimately the entire power system now ‘in power and secure’ inside the USA and throughout the world must be radically transformed. It does not matter who is POTUS (President Of The United States) when those who are really ‘in power and secure’ are still the ruling class of corporate capitalist elites.\n\nFascism uses economic reform, mass marketing psychology and timely false promises to keep itself ‘in power and secure’. It constantly attempts to defuse, divide and distract the natural striving of the people for significant social change via revolution.\n\nOther comrades in other countries may be confronted with completely different settings unique to their situation than our own particular situation. I am here now inside the USA typing. There is no magical single template for revolution to cover all situations. Revolutions cannot simply be copied or imported. The roots of revolution must spring up out of the basic survival interests, common dreams and collective goals of the people in a given situation. Thus, we need to comprehend the conscious concentration on the coordination of global communications as essential for there to be Global Revolution.\n\nEach of us must operate from our own immediate present situation. Each of us must deal with our own local or regional situation with a global overview. We can and should learn from other comrades elsewhere, but no one is going to go where were are on an existential level and do the basic local community education and mass mobilization that we must do ourselves in communion with the local population.\n\nRelevant Revolution:\n\nHistory has taught us that a relevant revolution requires a general strategy that emphasizes the seizure of state power by the people’s armed vanguard elements with various specific tactics depending on the immediate situation. Tactics are the means to an end strategy.\n\nMany folks confuse a revolt with an actual revolution. Look at Egypt! The same evil forces before the revolt are still ‘in power and secure’. There has been no revolution in Egypt, though the basic groundwork has been done, especially in the courageous consciousness of the Egyptian masses and their magnificent capacity to overcome their fear of the repressors.\n\nA basic requirement of revolution is a total transformation of property relations between the 1% of the ‘haves’ and the 99% of the ‘have-nots’. Property rights must be reversed between the 1% and the 99% in favor of the overwhelming majority of the people who compose the 99%. The people must have ownership and control of the land and all the viable social institutions thereon. If there is no substantial transformation of property relations there is no real revolution.\n\nIn the past, feudalism was revolutionary when it overthrew the rule of ancient barbarism. Capitalism was revolutionary when it overthrew feudalism. A genuine people’s democratic socialism will be revolutionary when it overthrows or transforms corporate capitalism. We are still in a class society where we still have classes at war. The two main social-economic classes are still the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’. Those of us here now inside the USA still endure under a corporate capitalist economic system whose ruling elites are in control of the most advanced form of authoritarian fascism with the strongest military machine in all of human history to date.\n\nOnly the masses of people can make or ‘manufacture’ the revolution, not vanguard elements alone. On a level of mass consciousness the people must come to know through their own direct experience the practical necessity and logical possibility of a relevant revolution. Ideally we want to bring about a Peaceful Revolution, yet we must keep in mind that connected reality does not always conform to our ideas and ideals. We must always uphold our basic sacred right to self-defense by any means necessary. We shall not allow ourselves to be carted away into new high-tech concentration camps or just be slaughtered without retaliation in the streets. We will not allow ourselves to be killed by armed fascists in the misguided name of non-violent passive resistance. Will you allow your family to be killed? All of us are of the huge family of humanity.\n\nWe cannot ignore the urgings of some for violent revolution, but neither do we want to lead people into a bloodbath in their own blood. Many confused comrades are unstable fanatics who need more revolutionary education. We have seen violent revolutions in the past establish new regimes, yet they tend to become evil and corrupt. Look at the former Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China and North Korea! The so-called model socialist societies supported by the old Left-wing vanguard have become brutal totalitarian regimes. Clearly past analyses by dead heroes have been grossly defective and much has gone awry in the revolutionary processes of certain countries.\n\nRevolution Is A Process:\n\nWe can now see that revolution is an extremely complex process. It is not a simple matter of vanguard elements shooting their way into state power, the seizure of the state and the fair social redistribution of the material wealth in society. Remember Companero Salvador Allende of Chile! Revolution is not all cut-and-dry. Revolution is a dynamic living process, not a fixed set of frozen conclusions. It is important to understand how a given revolution comes to power after a protracted war. What kind of seeds of counter-revolution are actually planted when there is a social revolution? How does revolutionary vanguard leadership prevent any future counter-revolution?\n\nWhen violence is used to achieve success in a revolutionary process many lives are taken, people in the thousands can be killed, critical mistakes are made on violent battlefields and future lifelong resentments are embedded into the psyche. These embedded resentments can grow and fester in the memories of people who feel that the successful revolutionary forces have wronged them or their blood families. Resentments are powerful psycho-social factors that breed in the psyche. We either learn to let go of our past resentments or we will try to get even one way or the other against those who have wronged us. It is our human nature.\n\nOf course, a violent revolution is a bloody messy phenomena. Imagine all the resentments of Cubans whose family members were killed by Che Guevara and other militants after the Cuban revolution in the name of revengeful retribution? Look at how Brother Nelson Mandela had the genius to call for reconciliation in South Africa. There is no pure revolution. It is the nature of the beast that revolutions, no matter how idealistic, create deep long-term resentments. Thus, we need to patiently educate and convince the people about the goals and aspirations of Global Revolution in order to prevent a reactionary counter-revolution.\n\nOnly a fool or a fanatic would propose and openly avow any kind of violent revolution in the world without taking into full consideration ‘concrete analyses of concrete conditions’, then designing the appropriate general strategy and tactics applicable to the given general situation before us.\n\nVanguard Leadership:\n\nWe need vanguard leadership. Naturally, the whole concept of a leaderless revolution must be viewed objectively as utterly insane, idealistic and a trick of psycho-social manipulation. Many past leaders have proven themselves to be mis-leaders or even agent-provocateurs sent in by dark forces to sow discord and internal division among progressive peoples. We do need leaders and we need followers who can become leaders. Ideally each of us should be a leader. Leadership must develop and train cadres to provide new fresh leadership. We will do well when we coordinate our activities closely with others working together in true solidarity.\n\nWe need to examine the whole concept of participatory democracy, register people to vote and utilize the U.S. electoral system as another important tactical tool in our toolbox. No tactic can be discounted. A lot of us just need to use our imagination, learn better how to utilize Internet Power and promote universal literacy wherever we are.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOn an personal level, as a humane being, I would prefer to help bring about social change and ultimately global transformation of the established order via peaceful methods of struggle. We need to exhaust all peaceful methods of struggle and not slip into Left-wing adventurism. Each of us must figure out life for our own self, unite with natural allies and seek a Unity of Purpose to help create a new brave world.\n\nWe need to create a new brave world, create a culture of liberation and not forget to conscientiously work on our own spiritual enlightenment as humane beings who have care, concern and compassion for all living beings.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Gulen, a former Erdogan ally turned arch-foe, strongly denies Ankara’s claims.Erdogan has said the assassination plot left him minutes from death after he fled the resort in Marmaris, where he had been holidaying with his family, and went back to Istanbul by plane.Some Erdogan supporters had called for the plotters to face the death penalty, which Turkey abolished in 2004 as part of its bid to join the European Union. -- AFP==========D.K.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "14ymedio\n\n14ymedio is the first independent digital media outlet in Cuba. It was founded on May 21, 2014, by the Cuban blogger and activist Yoani Sánchez and the Cuban journalist Reinaldo Escobar.  The project started with a group of 12 reporters, whose objective was to produce a digital media outlet with different types of news. The newspaper contains news about Cuba and the world, in topics related to national politics, international politics, economy, culture, society, science and technology, and sports. It also publishes editorials, opinion articles, and interviews.\n\nThe name ‘14ymedio’ characterizes the project in several ways. First, the number '14' is because the newspaper was born \"on the fourteenth floor, in the fourteenth year of the new millennium\". The letter 'Y' has been a constant characteristic in other projects of Yoani Sánchez, its founder, who also founded “Generación Y”; while ‘medio’ refers to the media and to the journalistic connotation of the project.\n\n14ymedio is born in digital format in one of the countries with the lowest internet connectivity across the globe. Given the political situation in Cuba, where the government controls all media and regularly blocks access to websites that are hostile to its administration, the newspaper operates without access to the internet. The team uploads the information by using Wifi access from hotels.  Currently, most Cubans do not have access to the publication, since only 2.6 million people out of the 11.2 million total population has internet access, and many of them can only see the intranet that is owned and controlled by the government.\n\nHistory \n14ymedio starts as personal project of its founder: Yoani Sánchez, the founder 'Generación Y', a blog that now has about a thousand published texts and more than a million comments. Its main objective is \"to inform, to open space for debate, to respect those who think differently, and to harmonize free speech with civic responsibility\". For its initial funding, the newspaper received approximately $150.000 in private investment.\n\nThe first edition of 14ymedio was focused on a wide variety of topics, including politics, culture and society. It offered a critique to the Cuban healthcare system and questioned the status of baseball as the national sport. Its cover included the story \"Red Dawn: Havana is killing out there\", by Víctor Ariel González, in which violence in the capital of the island is discussed; an opinion article about the economic reforms promoted by Raúl Castro, written by the dissident blogger Miriam Celaya.\n\nThree hours after 14ymedio published its first edition on the internet, the site was hacked. Those who tried to access the site were redirected to a webpage titled “Yoani$landia”, which mentioned that Cubans are tired about the fact that Yoani Sánchez tries to portray herself as the 'Mother Teresa of Calcutta' of the Cuban dissidents.\nInternet technicians later on tested it was ETECSA, the communications monopoly of the Cuban government, that hacked the page. From places outside Cuba, users can access the site without any restriction.\n\nRecognizing that restricting access to the site was an initiative of the Cuban government, Yoani Sánchez published in her Twitter account: “Wrong strategy from the Cuban government. There is nothing more attractive than the forbidden\".\n\nThe actions of the Cuban government against 14ymedio have provoked various reactions in the international arena. The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) blamed the Cuban government for restricting the access to the site and promoting censorship. They claimed that the government's actions show that Cuban rulers still believe that \"freedom of expression is a grant and not a human right\". Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, condemned the blockade on her Twitter account too.\n\nDespite these actions against the newspaper, 14ymedio has not stopped publishing daily since the day of its release. The site showed consistency in its publications and growth in terms of the number of people it reached. By May 2014, 14ymedio had reached 6,000 followers on Facebook and 11,500 on Twitter.\n\n14ymedio has also been internationally recognized by a variety of leading international newspapers and media outlets. Al-Jazeera highlighted that 14ymedio is \"the first independent media outlet in Cuba in 50 years to test the Castro regime's tolerance for dissent\". BBC considered that 14ymedio will  \"contribute with information so that Cubans can decide with more maturity their own destinies\", while Vice News described the newspaper as \"a new player in town in the homogenous media landscape of the communist island that is already testing the limits of the government’s strict controls on the digital sphere”.\n\nContent \nCurrently, 14ymedio publishes more than a dozen of articles per day. It publishes both original content and international news that come from other agencies, such as:\n International news, through agreements and partnerships with other news agencies\n National news and pictures\n Debates, which include a wide variety of topics ranging from domestic and international politics to social and cultural events\n Photogalleries, which show the reality of Cuba through pictures\n Interviews with national and international figures such as Joe Biden, Mario Vargas Llosa, Lech Walesa, etc.\n Cultural events, through a comprehensive cultural agenda with events that are happening every month in Havana and other provinces\n Market prices, where the prices of basic goods in various markets of Cuba are published\n\n14ymedio reports in real time on national and international events that may be relevant to those living in Cuba. Similarly, it seeks to inform those living outside Cuba about the situation in the island. When Cuba and the United States announced the normalization of their diplomatic relations in December 2014, 14ymedio was the only independent newspaper present in Cuba, reporting on the news and reactions in real time. The articles that were published by 14ymedio were quoted in major newspapers and media outlets such as  The New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine, El País, and others. Similarly, 14ymedio was a vital source of information during Roberta Jacobson's visit to Cuba. The Assistant Secretary of State even visited the headquarters of 14ymedio in Havana.\n\nAs a consequence of the positive response that the newspaper received from the public, the team decided to launch an English Edition, to allow non-Spanish speaking readers to receive information directly from Cuba, about the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States as well as about the general situation of the island. The English Edition of 14ymedio works thanks to the collaboration of volunteer translators, who are responsible of translating the articles that might be relevant for people in the United States or in other English speaking countries.\n\n14ymedio's team \n14ymedio's team is directed by Yoani Sánchez, and operates from her apartment in Cuba. It is conformed by 12 reporters and collaborators. Some of the members of the team are  Lilianne Ruiz; Luz Escobar, Reinaldo Escobar's daughter; and Víctor Ariel González, son of the dissident blogger Miriam Celaya.\n\nBy the end of 2014, several members of 14ymedio's team were arrested. Reinaldo Escobar, for example, was detained as he left his own apartment; he was handcuffed and taken to patrol n.628, that was waiting for him in front of the building. Víctor Ariel González was also detained for a couple hours. During that day, Yoani Sánchez remained under house arrest.\n\nEditorial line \n14ymedio seeks to counter the monopoly of the official media, and believes that the press plays an important role in the formation of civic consciousness and the conquest of freedom. The members of the team insist that 14ymedio is not a blog or a newspaper from the opposition. They define 14ymedio as a way to balance the flood of official information by neutrally emphasizing on the issues that the government does not want to inform.\n\nVictor Ariel González said that the newspaper is born with the idea that someday there will be a democracy in Cuba, and that people will read 14ymedio and say: \"well, this newspaper has been publishing since those times when it was prohibited to do so\". Similarly, Sánchez explained that 14ymedio has the promise of being independent and transparent, and claimed that she chose online journalism over politics, in order to express her criticism on the Cuban current system, rather than participating in politics as a member of the opposition.\n\nCuban government position towards 14ymedio\n\nAccording to the Granma, the official newspaper of Cuba, the purpose of 14ymedio is to \"feed campaigns of disinformation and defamation against Cuba\". The Cuban government also affirmed that 14ymedio is one of the projects of rebellion that the United States government funds and support in Cuba.\n\nRecognition\n\n14ymedio's work is now potentiated with the ‘Yahoo! Fellowship’ that Yoani Sánchez obtained from Georgetown University, in recognition of her work towards the promotion of online freedom of expression. ‘Yahoo! Fellow’ is a research scholarship on International Values, Communications, Technology and the Global Internet that will allow Sánchez to share her experience of launching an online newspaper in a closed society. Sánchez expressed that the fellowship at Georgetown is an opportunity for her to improve the quality of her own work, to empower independent journalism in Cuba, and to interact with students and faculty in order to broaden her perspective of the world and of Cuba itself.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Censorship in Cuba\nCategory:Internet properties established in 2014\nCategory:Cuban news websites\nCategory:2014 establishments in Cuba", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Wipes have been made from a variety of materials which can be dry or wet when used. Wet wipes can be moistened with a variety of suitable wiping solutions. Typically, wet wipes have been stacked in a container in either a folded or unfolded configuration. For example, containers or dispensers for wet wipes have been available wherein each of the wet wipes stacked in the container has been arranged in a folded configuration such as a c-folded, z-folded or quarter-folded configuration as are well known to those skilled in the art. Sometimes the folded wet wipes have also been interfolded with the wet wipes immediately above and below in the stack of wet wipes. In an alternative configuration, the wet wipes have been placed in the container in the form of a continuous web of material which includes perforations to separate the individual wet wipes and which can be wound into a roll. Such wet wipes have been used for baby wipes, hand wipes, household cleaning wipes, industrial wipes and the like.\nThe conventional packages which contain wipes, such as those described above, have typically been designed to be positioned on a flat surface such as a countertop, changing table or the like. Such conventional packages have generally provided a plastic container, tub or package which provides a sealed environment for the wet wipes to ensure that they do not become overly dry. Some of the conventional packages have also been configured to provide one at a time dispensing of each wet wipe which can be accomplished using a single hand after the package has been opened. Such single handed, one at a time dispensing, often referred to as xe2x80x9cpop-upxe2x80x9d dispensing, is particularly desirable because the other hand of the user or care giver is typically required to be simultaneously used for other functions. For example, when changing a diaper product on an infant, the care giver typically uses one hand to hold and maintain the infant in a desired position while the other hand is attempting to dispense a baby wipe to clean the infant.\nHowever, the dispensing of wipes from such conventional containers for wipes has not been completely satisfactory. For example, this is due at least in part to the orifice through which wipes within the container are dispensed. In particular, for example, this concerns the configuration and characteristics of the orifice for dispensing a stack of wipes that are separably joined to each adjacent wipe in the stack to provide pop-up dispensing once an initial wipe in the stack is dispensed through the orifice. As another example, this can concern the relationship of a group of wipes in the stack to other wipes in the stack if groups of wipes make up the stack of wipes. As yet another example, these relationships between wipes concern, in conjunction with the wipes, the container from which the wipes are dispensed and characteristics thereof. The present invention builds upon the teaching disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/538,711 filed Mar. 30, 2000 entitled xe2x80x9cWET WIPE CONTAINER WITH FLEXIBLE ORIFICExe2x80x9d and assigned to the assignee of the present application, which prior application is incorporated fully herein by reference.\nIn response to the difficulties and problems discussed above, for example, new orifice configurations and characteristics enabling improved dispensing, and which may be more cost effective and reliable (e.g., reducing the likelihood of wipe fallback and/or reducing the likelihood of multiple wipes dispensing undesirably), have been discovered. For example, dispensing can be improved or made easier when a wipe is ready for dispensing upon the opening of a resealable wipes dispenser after the initial opening of the dispenser and use of a first wipe in a plurality of wipes. That is, a portion of the wipe is positioned in an orifice of the dispenser sufficiently protruding so a user can readily grasp the same and remove the entire individual wipe without premature tearing or non-dispensing of the top wipe. As another example wipe fallback can occur when a leading wipe in a plurality of wipes separates completely from a following or trailing wipe prematurely, i.e., before a sufficient portion of the following wipe is positioned within the dispenser orifice to remain there for later dispensing after the leading wipe is fully separated or disjointed from the trailing wipe outside the dispenser. In such a fallback situation, the following wipe would need to be re-threaded through the dispensing orifice when its dispensing is next desired. This may not be undesirable if done intentionally, i.e., if maintaining a maximum moisture level for the wipes is desired and the dispensing orifice is designed to easily accommodate reach-in retrieval of the next wipe. As yet another example multiple wipes dispensing can occur when a leading individual wipe in a plurality of wipes does not timely separate completely from a following individual wipe while the following wipe is still at least partially maintained in the dispensing orifice, i.e., the following wipe dispenses completely out of the dispenser with the leading wipe causing two (or more) wipes to dispense substantially simultaneously. This can be desirable when two (or more) wipes are needed, but if only one is desired, then this is not preferred. The purposes and features of the present invention will be set forth in and are apparent from the description that follows, as well as will be learned by practice of the invention. Additional features of the invention will be realized and attained by the product and processes particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof, as well as from the appended drawings.\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing with a wet wipes dispenser. The orifice includes a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. A first portion of the sheet has a first thickness and a second portion of the sheet located between the continuous slit and the first portion has a second thickness which is greater than or less than the first thickness.\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a wet wipes dispenser having a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing. The dispenser includes a rigid port positioned adjacent an end portion of the dispenser. The rigid port surrounds a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. A first portion of the sheet has a first thickness and a second portion of the sheet located between the continuous slit and the first portion has a second thickness which is greater than or less than the first thickness.\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing with a wet wipes dispenser. The orifice includes a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. At least one hinge is located between the continuous slit and a surrounding portion of the sheet wherein a side of the sheet adjacent the continuous slit can pivot relative to the surrounding portion of the sheet via the hinge.\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing with a wet wipes dispenser. The orifice includes a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. The continuous slit has at least one curved portion connected with at least one non-curved portion.\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a wet wipes dispenser having a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing. The dispenser includes a rigid port positioned adjacent an end portion of the dispenser, the dispenser having a longitudinal axis and a lateral axis. The rigid port surrounds a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. The continuous slit has at least one curved portion connected with at least one non-curved portion.\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a flexible orifice for pop-up style dispensing with a wet wipes dispenser. The orifice includes a flexible, rubber-like sheet having a top surface and a bottom surface. A continuous slit extends across the top and bottom surfaces of the sheet and enables a wet wipe to pass from the bottom surface to the top surface or from the top surface to the bottom surface. The continuous slit has at least one zigzag portion connected with a pair of end leg portions.\nIn yet other aspects, the invention provides various configurations for the sheet, the continuous slit and orientations of portions of the continuous slit and of the continuous slit relative to the dispenser.\nIn still other aspects, the invention is provided for use in various types of dispensers and for dispensing in various manners such as reach-in dispensing and pop-up dispensing.\nAs used herein, wet wipes of the invention are considered xe2x80x9cseparably joinedxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cseparably joiningxe2x80x9d (and variations thereof) when each wipe of a plurality, e.g., in a stack of wipes, is engaging any adjacent wipe while in the dispenser or package such that withdrawing the leading wipe through the dispenser or package opening also withdraws at least a portion of the following wipe through the opening before the leading wipe and the following wipe separate completely from each other. Such engaging of any adjacent wipe can include a non-interfolded relationship in combination with one or more of the following between adjacent wipes: adhesive, friction, cohesion, fusion bonding (e.g., ultrasonic welding, heat sealing), mechanical entanglement (e.g., needle punching, steam sealing, embossing, crimping), autogeneous bonding, and/or weakened line(s) (e.g., perforations, zones of frangibility, score line(s), crush cutting).\nAs used herein, the xe2x80x9clongitudinal axisxe2x80x9d is determined by the line having the greatest number of intersections with the continuous slit. Such a longitudinal axis may be symmetrical relative to the continuous slit (e.g., FIGS. 11 and 12) or it may be askew (e.g., line 18 in FIGS. 13 and 14 relative to the continuous slit), but in any event the longitudinal axis must be the line that will have the greatest number of intersections with the continuous slit of the invention.\nAs used herein, xe2x80x9czigzagxe2x80x9d means a portion of the continuous slit which crosses or touches the longitudinal axis at least three times. As such, the continuous slit could be curved (e.g. as seen in FIGS. 11-14) or it could comprise the combination of curved and/or straight line segments, as long as the segments are connected to one another and configured to cross or touch the longitudinal axis at least three times. For example, in FIG. 11 a zigzag would be represented by the combination of half cycles 48 and 44 at locations a and b. Additional half cycles c, d, etc. could be included to also define the zigzag portion of the continuous slit, but such goes beyond the minimum requirement of crossing the longitudinal axis 62 at least three times.\nAs used herein, when the following wipe that has at least a portion through the opening of the dispenser or package is intentionally maintained in the opening after the leading wipe is completely separated from the following wipe, this is referred to as xe2x80x9cpop-upxe2x80x9d format or dispensing. To be intentionally maintained in the opening means the opening is configured to so maintain the wipe therein, such as through use of a constricting orifice or opening being smaller than the wipe in at least one dimension of the wipe.\nAs used herein, xe2x80x9creach-inxe2x80x9d dispensing is understood to mean having to fetch a wipe out of a dispenser through an opening substantially co-extensive with the walls of the dispenser or through a restricted opening smaller than the perimeter defined by the walls. In either case, the top wipe for dispensing rests on top of the remainder of the stack of wipes and the top wipe needs to be separated from the remainder of the stack each time anew when dispensing is desired. An example of a reach-in dispenser is found in the currently available baby wipes product sold by Kimberly-Clark Corporation of Neenah, Wis. under the trade name HUGGIES(copyright) Supreme Care.\nAs used herein, the term xe2x80x9crigidxe2x80x9d is used to mean a level of stiffness commonly associated with materials used to manufacture wet wipes tubs. Numerically, these materials typically have a flexural modulus (as measured in accordance with ASTM D790 xe2x80x9cStandard Test Method for Flexural Properties of Unreinforced and Reinforced Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materialsxe2x80x9d) of about 500 Newtons per square millimeter or greater, more specifically from about 1100 to about 1550 Newtons per square millimeter.\nIt is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention claimed. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, are included to illustrate and provide a further understanding of the wipes of the invention. Together with the description, the drawings serve to explain the various aspects of the invention.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Sunday, October 25, 2009\n\nWhy Does Iodine Get a Bad Rap?\n\nI have received many emails this week asking me to comment about a recent article claiming that taking iodine causes/exacerbates thyroid problems.\n\nLet’s think about it.Thyroid problems have been increasing at epidemic rates over the last 30 years.Hypothyroidism affects from 13 million to 45 million Americans.Another 10-15 million Americans are affected with an autoimmune thyroid disorder.Clearly these numbers are unacceptable and we should be searching for the underlying cause of why thyroid illness affects so many people.\n\nWhen I lecture about iodine, I describe iodine as, “The most misunderstood nutrient.”Iodine has been vilified over the years as causing/exacerbating thyroid illnesses.In medical school I was taught that iodine supplementation was not needed by anybody.I can assure you that statement is incorrect.\n\nOver the last 30 years, as the rate of thyroid disorders has been increasing at epidemic rates, iodine levels have fallen by over 50% in the U.S. (NHANES--from cdc.gov).If iodine were the cause of thyroid disorders wouldn’t you expect thyroid disorders to be decreasing over the last 30 years?In fact, I believe it is iodine deficiency, coupled with the increasing exposure to toxic halides bromide and fluoride that is the driving force behind the epidemic rise of thyroid disorders.\n\nLet me ask you a question--what percentage of the American population has been taking iodine supplements over the last 30 years? I don’t have the exact numbers to quote here, but I would venture a guess that the number is pretty low.So, during the last 30 years, as iodine levels have fallen over 50%, what is the problem that is causing this new epidemic of thyroid problems?Maybe thyroid diseases have increased so dramatically because of televisions.Americans have more televisions now than in the past.Perhaps it is more televisions that are causing the increased thyroid problems.(As a side note—televisions do contain large amounts of bromine which can cause thyroid problems!).\n\nI know the above argument is ridiculous (except for the bromine info).But, so is the idea that iodine supplementation is responsible for exacerbating/causing all thyroid problems.Over the last 20 years of practice, I have seen thousands of patients who have presented with hyperthyroid or hypothyroid symptoms who were not taking iodine.What caused their symptoms?Why does iodine always get a bad rap?\n\nNow, that is not to say that iodine is safe for everyone to take.Just as drinking too much water can cause problems, iodine supplementation can also cause adverse effects in certain patients.By far, the most common adverse effect of iodine supplementation is due to the release of toxic halides bromide and fluoride.Iodine supplementation causes the release of bromide and fluoride from the body creating a detoxification issue for the body.If the body is not able to effectively release these toxic halides, the patient will experience a detoxification reaction.What are the signs of a detoxification reaction?A detoxification reaction can include fatigue, palpitations, nervousness, anxiety, and headaches.Sometimes you can even see elevated thyroid function tests associated with the detoxification reaction.Most of the time, these symptoms can easily be managed by supporting the body’s detoxification pathways.\n\nIn my experience, I have found the proper use of iodine to be a safe and effective treatment for the vast majority of patients. In order to get the best results with iodine, it is important for iodine to be taken as part of a holistic treatment regimen.This minimizes detoxification reactions. I suggest getting your iodine levels checked before and after supplementation with iodine. More information about this can be found in my book, Iodine Why You Need It, Why You Can’t Live Without It.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "This invention relates to nonvolatile memories and methods of forming nonvolatile memories. In particular, this application relates to nonvolatile memory arrays in which floating gate memory cells individually hold one or more bits of data.\nNonvolatile memory systems are used in various applications. Some nonvolatile memory systems are embedded in a larger system such as a personal computer. Other nonvolatile memory systems are removably connected to a host system and may be interchanged between different host systems. Examples of such removable memory systems include memory cards and USB flash drives. Electronic circuit cards, including non-volatile memory cards, have been commercially implemented according to a number of well-known standards. Memory cards are used with personal computers, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital still cameras, digital movie cameras, portable audio players and other host electronic devices for the storage of large amounts of data. Such cards usually contain a re-programmable non-volatile semiconductor memory cell array along with a controller that controls and supports operation of the memory cell array and interfaces with a host to which the card is connected. Several of the same type of card may be interchanged in a host card slot designed to accept that type of card. However, the development of the many electronic card standards has created different types of cards that are incompatible with each other in various degrees. A card made according to one standard is usually not useable with a host designed to operate with a card of another standard. Memory card standards include PC Card, CompactFlash™ card (CF™ card), SmartMedia™ card, MultiMediaCard (MMC™), Secure Digital (SD) card, a miniSD™ card, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), Memory Stick™, Memory Stick Duo card and microSD/TransFlash™ memory module standards. There are several USB flash drive products commercially available from SanDisk Corporation under its trademark “Cruzer®.” USB flash drives are typically larger and shaped differently than the memory cards described above.\nDifferent types of memory array architecture are used in nonvolatile memory systems. In one type of architecture, a NAND array, a series of strings of more than two memory cells, such as 16 or 32, are connected along with one or more select transistors between individual bit lines and a reference potential to form columns of cells. Word lines extend across cells within a large number of these columns. Typically word lines, bit lines and other similar conductive components are formed by patterning a conductive layer using a pattern established by photolithography.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Aneuploidies and micronuclei in the germ cells of male mice of advanced age.\nThe objective of this research was to determine whether the frequencies of chromosomally defective germ cells increased with age in male laboratory mice. Two types of chromosomal abnormalities were characterized: (1) testicular spermatid aneuploidy (TSA) as measured by a new method of multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes specific for mouse chromosomes X, Y and 8, and (2) spermatid micronucleus (SMN) analyses using anti-kinetochore antibodies. B6C3F1 mice (aged 22.5 to 30.5 months, heavier than controls but otherwise in good health) showed significant approximately 2.0 fold increases in the aneuploidy phenotypes X-X-8, Y-Y-8, 8-8-X and 8-8-Y with the greatest effects appearing in animals aged greater than 28 months. No age effect was observed, however, in X-Y-8 hyperhaploidy. Major age-related increases were seen in Y-Y-8 and X-X-8 hyperhaploidies suggesting that advanced paternal age is associated primarily with meiosis II rather than meiosis I disjunction errors. A approximately 5 fold increase was also found in the frequency of micronucleated spermatids in aged mice when compared with young controls. All micronuclei detected in the aged animals lacked kinetochore labeling, suggesting that they either did not contain intact chromosomes or the chromosomes lacked detectable kinetochores. The findings of the TSA and SMN assays are consistent with meiotic or premeiotic effects of advanced age on germ cell chromosomes, but there were differences in the age dependencies of aneuploidy and micronuclei. In summary, advanced paternal age may be a risk factor for chromosomal abnormalities (both aneuploidy and structural abnormalities) in male germ cells.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality which can be attributed to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease \\[[@CR1]\\]. It is estimated that type II diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease even after adjustment of other cardiovascular risk factors \\[[@CR2]\\]. Despite the increase in the rate of treatment of diabetic patients with statins and glucose lowering drugs achieving target glycated hemoglobin (HBA1C) levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels \\[[@CR3]\\], another strategy of effective management of diabetes lies in management of the disease process at earlier stage \\[[@CR1]\\]. Prediabetes is a collective term that encloses individuals with glucose levels lower than cutoff levels for diabetes but too high to be considered normal. It is the term used for individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or HbA1C levels ranging from 5.7 to 6.4% \\[[@CR3]\\]. Prediabetes is not an uncommon condition with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 343 million individuals expected to rise to 471 million by 2035 \\[[@CR4]\\]. Prediabetes is a serious clinical condition that not only increases the risk of developing diabetes but also increases the burden of cardiovascular disease risk. Compared to normoglycemic individuals, patients with prediabetes show a 20% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) \\[[@CR5]\\]. Prediabetes is a toxic state in which both micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes can manifest \\[[@CR6]\\]. The prompt diagnosis and proper management of prediabetes are necessary to prevent progression to diabetes mellitus and to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications that manifest early in the prediabetic state \\[[@CR7]\\]***.***\n\nAim of the work {#Sec2}\n===============\n\nObserves the effect of prediabetes on the severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.\n\nMethods {#Sec3}\n=======\n\nThe current study was carried out at the cardiology department at a university hospital.\n\nInclusion criteria {#Sec4}\n------------------\n\nPatients who were admitted for elective coronary angiography and/or PCI starting from September 2017 to August 2018.\n\nExclusion criteria {#Sec5}\n------------------\n\nNo exclusion criteria were applied.\n\nAfter an informed written consent, all patients involved in the study were subjected to:\n\n**A- History taking and examination** with special emphasis on age, sex, risk factors for coronary artery disease (smoking, HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, positive family history for premature CVDs), history of CKD detected either by reduction in GFR or high serum creatinine, history of prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary arteries bypass grafting (CABG), or acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n**B- Laboratory tests**: Level of HBA1C and serum creatinine on admission.\n\n**C- Estimation of renal function**: eGFR was estimated using MDRD formula:\n\neGFR = 186 × (serum creatinine)--1.154 × age--0.0203 (× 1.210 if black) (× 0.742 if female) \\[[@CR8]\\]\n\n**D- Interventional data**: Number of vessels affected and atherosclerotic burden of CAD assessed by Gensini score \\[[@CR9]\\]***.*** For patients undergoing PCI, additional data was collected regarding number of stents used, type of stents used, and total length of stents used.\n\nThe studied patients were divided according to HbA1C level to 3 groups:\n\n1- Group A: Normoglycemic patients (HBA1C \\< 5.7%)\n\n2- Group B: Prediabetic patients (HBA1C 5.7--6.4%)\n\n3- Group C: Diabetic patients (HBA1C \\> 6.4%) \\[[@CR10]\\]\n\nStatistical analysis {#Sec6}\n--------------------\n\nData were collected and revised on PC. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed using SPSS 17 software, mean and standard deviation (± SD), and range for parametric numerical data, while the median was used for nonparametric numerical data. Student t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the difference between two study group means. Mann--Whitney test (U test) was used to assess the statistical significance of the difference of a nonparametric variable between two study groups. Chi-squared test was used to examine the relationship between two qualitative variables.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of prediabetes on angiographic outcomes in those patients. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were prediabetics constituting 24% of the study population. Similar prevalence of prediabetes was demonstrated among elective PCI patients and ACS patients in various registries \\[[@CR11], [@CR12]\\]. Patients with prediabetes had the same age range as diabetics and normoglycemic subjects, yet female gender was more prevalent among the diabetic group. This can be explained by the findings of Kodama et al. \\[[@CR13]\\] suggesting that cardiovascular risk in the diabetic population is higher among women than in men. Although Kataoka et al. \\[[@CR14]\\] and Choi et al. \\[[@CR11]\\] found no significant difference in age between normoglycemic and prediabetic groups, the results of both showed male preponderance across the different groups. There were more smokers in the prediabetes group compared to diabetics (Choi et al.) \\[[@CR11]\\]**.** However, we found that smoking was not significantly different between normoglycemic patients and prediabetics. There was a parallel increase in the prevalence of hypertension with increase in HBA1C. This can be attributed to insulin resistance promoting both hypertension and diabetes (Sowers) \\[[@CR15]\\] or a myriad of genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of both diabetes and hypertension \\[[@CR16]\\]*.* Choi et al. \\[[@CR11]\\] also demonstrated a higher prevalence of hypertension among prediabetic patients than normoglycemic patients undergoing elective PCI. Similarly, Zhang et al. \\[[@CR17]\\] demonstrated that hypertension was more common in prediabetics than normoglycemic subjects and in diabetic group more than prediabetic group. Patients with prediabetes had a prevalence of dyslipidemia which was comparable to diabetics and normoglycemic subjects. Nakamura et al. \\[[@CR18]\\] demonstrated that among CAD patients, prediabetics and diabetics showed a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia, yet this was evident in postprandial lipid levels and not the fasting lipid levels which are used as the standard screening test. Similarly, Açar et al. \\[[@CR12]\\] found no difference in prevalence of dyslipidemia between prediabetic, normoglycemic, and diabetic subjects. The prevalence of CKD was not significantly different among the three groups, although diabetes is known as a common comorbid risk factor for CKD \\[[@CR19]\\] as well as CKD pathophysiology starting in prediabetic subjects \\[[@CR20]\\]. Those results are similar to Zhang et al. \\[[@CR17]\\] and Choi et al. \\[[@CR11]\\] who found no significant difference in prevalence of CKD among CAD patients. This can be attributed to hindering of both pharmacological and interventional treatment of cardiovascular disease by the presence of CKD in addition to increments in the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy with worsening of renal function; the management plan of CAD in CKD patients is directed towards more conservative management \\[[@CR21], [@CR22]\\]. Prediabetic subjects showed involvement of coronary arteries with a more aggressive atherosclerotic process resulting in CAD severity that was significantly higher than normoglycemic subjects and comparable to diabetic subjects. The number of coronary arteries with significant disease was higher in the prediabetic group than the normoglycemic group, yet there was no significant difference when compared with the diabetic group. This is similar to the findings of Santos et al. \\[[@CR23]\\] who demonstrated that among patients with CAD confirmed by angiography, prediabetes was more commonly associated with multivessel disease. In addition, Açar et al. \\[[@CR12]\\] found that among patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, diabetic and prediabetic patients showed significantly higher prevalence of three vessel diseases when compared to normoglycemic patients. The complexity of CAD assessed by Gensini score was higher in the prediabetic than in normoglycemic subjects and comparable with diabetics. This is similar to the results of Açar et al. \\[[@CR12]\\] where patients with prediabetes and diabetes showed a more complex coronary anatomy than normoglycemic subjects with a higher proportion of patients with three vessel diseases and higher CAD severity assessed by both SYNTAX and Gensini scores. This is in accordance with the results of Kataoka et al. \\[[@CR14]\\]; both prediabetes group and diabetes group showed a higher Gensini score when compared to those without diabetes. The glycemic state didn't affect the type of stent used, with drug-eluting stents (DESs) used in most of patients across the three groups. This goes hand in hand with Choi et al. \\[[@CR11]\\] as all patients of the different groups received DESs. When comparing the length of stent used among the different groups, both prediabetics and diabetics required significantly longer stents than normoglycemic patients. This can be attributed to the findings of De Rosa et al. \\[[@CR24]\\] who assessed plaque characteristics in stable CAD patients and demonstrated that both prediabetes and diabetes were associated with a higher and longer plaque burden. Zhang et al. \\[[@CR17]\\] assessed OCT data regarding non-infarct-related plaques in patents presenting with ACS and found that raised HBA1C in prediabetic subjects was associated with more complex and active plaque structure with longer lipid length, higher lipid content, thinner fibrous cap, higher macrophage infiltration, wider lipid arc, and more calcification than normal subjects but was comparable to diabetic subjects. HBA1C was independently associated with significantly higher lipid length. Those results agree with the findings of Kataoka et al. \\[[@CR14]\\] which demonstrated that both prediabetes and diabetes were associated with high average lesion length in patients with CAD assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. Similarly, Choi et al. \\[[@CR11]\\] found significantly longer lesions in prediabetics when compared to normoglycemic subjects.\n\nConclusion {#Sec13}\n==========\n\nPrediabetes is not merely a step closer to diabetes, it is a stage of diabetes which shows a similar atherosclerotic disease progression causing more complex coronary anatomy and requiring a higher number of longer stents. Yet, such a stage is always overlooked. Prediabetes confers high yet modifiable cardiovascular risk. Rigorous lifestyle interventions and medical treatment can help flatten the risk of conversion to diabetes, regression to normoglycemia, and reduction of the cardiovascular disease burden in this population.\n\nACS\n\n:   Acute coronary syndrome\n\nANOVA\n\n:   Analysis of variance\n\nBMS\n\n:   Bare metal stent\n\nCA\n\n:   Coronary angiography\n\nCABG\n\n:   Coronary artery bypass grafting\n\nCAD\n\n:   Coronary artery disease\n\nCKD\n\n:   Chronic kidney disease\n\nCVD\n\n:   Cardiovascular disease\n\nDES\n\n:   Drug eluting stent\n\nDM\n\n:   Diabetes mellitus\n\neGFR\n\n:   Estimated glomerular filtration rate\n\nGFR\n\n:   Glomerular filtration rate\n\nHTN\n\n:   Hypertension\n\nIFG\n\n:   Impaired fasting glucose\n\nIGT\n\n:   Impaired glucose tolerance\n\nIQR\n\n:   Interquartile range\n\nLDL\n\n:   Low-density lipoprotein\n\nLM\n\n:   Left main\n\nMDRD\n\n:   Modification of diet in renal disease\n\nNo.\n\n:   Number\n\nOCT\n\n:   Optical coherence tomography\n\nPCI\n\n:   Percutaneous coronary intervention\n\nSD\n\n:   Standard deviation\n\n**Publisher's Note**\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAM, SA, and AS performed the angiographies and angioplasties and analyzed and interpreted the patient data.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths reported in 2012 \\[[@R1]-[@R3]\\]. Only 16% of early-stage lung cancer is diagnosed, and the overall 5-year survival rate is only 15% \\[[@R4]\\]. Even after curative resection and systemic chemotherapy, a significant number of lung cancer patients die due to recurrence and distant metastases. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve survival of lung cancer patients is urgently needed.\n\nRab1A, a small GTPase, has been well established to mediate vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus \\[[@R5]\\]. It is a highly conserved protein, which has been identified in 158 different organisms, ranging from yeast to humans \\[[@R6], [@R7]\\]. Recently, a growing body of evidence has suggested that the Rab1A protein has additional functions beyond its role in vesicular transport, including nutrient sensing \\[[@R8]\\] and signaling \\[[@R9]\\], cell migration \\[[@R10]\\] and regulation of autophagy \\[[@R11]\\]. Moreover, aberrant expression of Rab1A has been linked to a range of human diseases including cardiomyopathy \\[[@R12]\\], Parkinson\\'s disease \\[[@R13]\\] and cancer \\[[@R8], [@R14]-[@R19]\\].\n\nRab1A has been identified as a colorectal oncogene, and elevated expression of Rab1A has been reported in multiple cancer types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) \\[[@R8]\\], hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \\[[@R18]\\], glioma \\[[@R14]\\], prostate cancer \\[[@R15], [@R17]\\], tongue squamous carcinoma \\[[@R16]\\] and cervical cancer \\[[@R19]\\]. Overexpression of Rab1A is correlated with a poor prognosis and has been proposed to promote tumor progression by activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway in CRC and HCC, indicating that Rab1A might be a valuable therapeutic target for personalized therapy \\[[@R8]\\]. Despite the importance of Rab1A in human malignancies, to date, Rab1A has not been studied in the context of lung cancer. In this study, we investigated Rab1A expression in tissues and cell lines from different lung cancer subtypes, and assessed the relationships between Rab1A expression and clinical parameters as well as key cancer cell signaling pathways.\n\nRESULTS {#s2}\n=======\n\nRab1A is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues {#s2_1}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate Rab1A expression in 60 lung cancer tissues and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Positive staining appeared brown. Rab1A was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm, and the percentage of nuclear expression is very low (less than 5%) in both noncancerous tissues and cancerous tissues. In contrast to the noncancerous tissues, Rab1A was significantly highly expressed in tumor cells (Figure [1A](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), while faint staining was present in stromal and lymphoid cells in paired noncancerous tissues. When using the median H score of 67.5 as a cutoff value, the overall rate of positive staining in lung cancer tissues (95%) was significantly higher than in paired noncancerous tissues (5%; P = 0.000; Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Compared with matched noncancerous tissues (median H score = 15), Rab1A staining was much stronger in lung cancer tissues (median H score = 189; Figure [1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). On an individual basis, Rab1A scored higher in approximately 96.67% (58/60) of tumors than in the corresponding noncancerous tissues, although Rab1A staining was remarkably variable, differing by as much as 100-fold between different tumor samples (Figure [1C](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). For different histological subtypes of lung cancer, Rab1A showed similar expression patterns (Figure [1D](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) with a 100% positive staining rate in adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma and large cell lung cancer tissues (Table [2](#T2){ref-type=\"table\"}). The H score in the adenocarcinoma group (median, 211.5) was higher than others histological types while the small cell lung cancer cohort showed the lowest H score (median, 121.5; Figure [1E](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n###### Rab1A expression in lung cancer and paired noncancerous tissues\n\n  Tissue type           Cases   Rab1A expression   P value   \n  --------------------- ------- ------------------ --------- -------\n  Lung cancer           60      57 (95)            3 (5)     0.000\n  Paired noncancerous   60      3 (5)              57 (95)   \n\nP = 0.000; cancer vs. paired noncancerous determined by Fisher\\'s exact test\n\n###### Rab1A expression in five pathological subtypes of lung cancer\n\n  Pathological subtype      Cases   Rab1A expression   P value   \n  ------------------------- ------- ------------------ --------- -------\n  Adenocarcinoma            20      20 (100)           0 (0)     \n  Squamous carcinoma        10      9 (90)             1 (10)    \n  Adenosquamous carcinoma   10      10 (100)           0 (0)     0.000\n  Large cell lung cancer    10      10 (100)           0 (0)     \n  Small cell lung cancer    10      8 (80)             2 (20)    \n\nAll P values = 0.000; cancer vs. paired noncancerous as determined by Fisher\\'s exact test.\n\n![Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in different histological types of lung cancer\\\n(**A**) IHC staining of human lung cancer tissue and noncancerous tissues.

Cases were divided into high and low Rab1A staining groups based on the median H score of 180 in cancer tissues. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that Rab1A staining is significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.002), and T stage (P = 0.039), as shown in Table [3](#T3){ref-type=\"table\"}. Large tumors and late T stage tumors consistently displayed higher Rab1A expression when compared with small tumor size and early T stage, indicating that Rab1A may promote tumor growth and progression. However, there were no significant associations observed between Rab1A expression and age, gender, lymph node status and AJCC stage.\n\n###### Association between Rab1A expression and clinicopathologic features\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Clinicopathologic\\         Cases   Rab1A expression   P value   \n  feature                                                         \n  -------------------------- ------- ------------------ --------- -------\n  Pathological grade                                              0.636\n\n   I                         14      6                  8         \n\n   II                        29      14                 15        \n\n   III                       17      8                  9         \n\n  Gender                                                          0.101\n\n   Male                      45      22                 23        \n\n   Female                    15      6                  9         \n\n  Age (years, Median = 62)                                        0.395\n\n   ≤62                       31      12                 19        \n\n   \\>62                      29      16                 13        \n\n  Tumor size\\                                                     0.002\n  (cm^3^, Median = 24)                                            \n\n   ≤24                       31      9                  22        \n\n   \\>24                      29      19                 10        \n\n  T stage                                                         0.039\n\n   T1-T2                     45      20                 25        \n\n   T3-T4                     15      8                  7         \n\n  Lymph node status                                               0.749\n\n   N0                        28      13                 15        \n\n   N1-N2                     32      18                 14        \n\n  AJCC stage                                                      0.779\n\n   I- II                     34      17                 17        \n\n   III-IV                    26      14                 12        \n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCases were divided by high Rab1A staining (H score ≥ 180) and low Rab1A staining (H score \\< 180).

Compared with the immortalized lung/bronchus epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, Rab1A is highly expressed in all lung cancer cell lines with great variability, ranging from a 6-fold increase in the A549 and H1650 cell lines to a 1.5-fold increase in H460 and SK-LU-1 cells lines (Figure [2A and B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These findings are consistent with Rab1A expression levels in lung cancer tissues. Because Rab1A has been reported to be correlated with hyperactive mTORC1 signaling in human colorectal cancer \\[[@R8]\\], we examined whether Rab1A expression was correlated with mTORC1 signaling in lung cancer. However, no significant correlation between Rab1A and P-S6K1 (T389) was observed in lung cancer cell line panels. We further examined substrates of other key cancer cell signaling pathways, including P-AKT (S473), P-ERK (T202/Y204), P-C-JUN (S63) and P-MK2 (T334), but no correlation between expression of these proteins and Rab1A expression was observed (Figure [2C-G](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that, under physiological conditions, Rab1A expression is not correlated with the basal expression levels of the mTORC1, mTORC2, MEK, JNK and p38MAPK signaling pathways in lung cancer.\n\n![Rab1A is overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines but is not correlated with mTORC or MAPK expression\\\n(**A**) Expression of Rab1A, P-S6K, S6K, P-AKT, AKT, P-ERK, ERK, P-MK2, MK2, P-c-Jun and c-Jun was examined in a panel of lung cancer cell lines by immunoblot.

Therefore, we examined whether Rab1A knockdown had similar effects in human lung cancers. Although Rab1A was successfully knocked down in a panel of lung cancer cell lines, no changes were observed with regards to mTORC1 (P-S6K1(T389)) or mTORC2 (P-AKT (S473)) signaling (Figure [3A](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

Our study for the first time shows that Rab1A is significantly overexpressed in lung cancer. These results indicate that Rab1A overexpression is widespread in human malignancies, consistent with its oncogenic function. In addition, in lung cancer, Rab1A expression levels were not correlated with histological type; different lung cancer subtype tissues and cell lines all showed significant Rab1A overexpression, suggesting that aberrant Rab1A expression is universal in lung cancers. It has been reported that Rab1A overexpression is correlated with disease progression and prognosis in CRC and HCC \\[[@R8],[@R18]\\]. Here we report that Rab1A overexpression is correlated with tumor volume and stage in lung cancer. This result indicates that Rab1A may contribute to lung cancer progression, and further emphasizes the important role of Rab1A in human malignancies.\n\nRecent studies have shown that Rab1 is a regulator of several central signal transduction pathways, particularly the mTOR pathway \\[[@R6],[@R21]\\]. Rab1A overexpression is a driver of mTORC1 signaling and mTORC1-dependent growth in CRC by regulating the interaction of mTORC1 with the small GTPase Rheb, which activates mTORC1 activity on the Golgi surface. However, unlike in CRC, Rab1A overexpression is not correlated with basal mTORC1 (P-S6K1) or mTORC2 (P-AKT (S473)) signaling in lung cancer cells, and Rab1A knockdown did not significantly alter mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity. In addition, Rab1A knockdown had no effect on cell growth or the induction of apoptosis (data not shown), which is consistent with a lack of effect on mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. These results indicate that, although Rab1A overexpression is a general phenomenon in human malignancies, its function and mechanism of action are highly variable in different cancer types. Rab1A did not regulate mTOR signaling in human lung cancer. It would be of interest to investigate whether Rab1B, a paralog of Rab1A, could play a major role in mTOR regulation in lung cancer.\n\nWe also analyzed a panel of lung cancer cell lines for additional key signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are often deregulated in human cancers \\[[@R22]-[@R24]\\]. Three distinct MAPK cascades, MEK/ERK, JNK/c-Jun and p38/MK2 were investigated, but no significant correlation with Rab1A was observed, indicating that MAPK pathways may not be involved in the mechanisms by which Rab1A contributes to lung cancer.\n\nIn light of the present data considered in the context of previous findings, we can hypothesize that Rab1A overexpression is associated with clinical pathological parameters of human lung cancer. Because this study examined limit number of cell lines from different histological subtypes, to achieve a sound conclusion, correlation between major cancer signaling pathways and the malignant role of Rab1A needs to be further evaluated in a larger sample set of cancer tissues/cancer cell lines from specific histological subtype of lung cancer. The mechanisms by which Rab1A overexpression contributes to lung cancer, including cell cycle progressing and promoting migration and metastasis, are under investigation.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#s4}\n=====================\n\nTissue array and immunohistochemistry {#s4_1}\n-------------------------------------\n\nSixty de-identified lung cancer tissues with paired adjacent noncancerous tissues were collected from the hospital between January 2007 and March 2008 and developed into tissue arrays by Shanghai OUTDO Biotech (Shanghai, China). Twenty adenocarcinomas, 10 squamous carcinomas, 10 adenosquamous carcinomas, 10 large cell carcinomas and 10 small cell carcinomas were included. The study protocols were approved by the SJTUSM (Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine) Ethics Committee. All procedures adhere to the BRISQ Guidelines for reporting research on human biospecimens.\n\nImmunohistochemical detection of Rab1A was performed using a streptavidin-biotin complex method as described previously \\[[@R8]\\]. The primary antibody against Rab1A (Proteintech Group) was used at a concentration of 1:100. To score a tumor cell as positive, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining was performed. For quantitative analysis, a Histo (H) score was calculated based on the staining intensity and percentage of stained cells using Aperio ScanScope systems (Vista, CA, USA). The intensity score was defined as follows: 0, no appreciable staining in cells; 1, weak staining in cells comparable with stromal cells; 2, intermediate staining; 3, strong staining. The fraction of positive cells was scored as 0%-100%. The H score was calculated as previously described, by multiplying the intensity score and the fraction score \\[[@R8]\\], producing a total range of 0-300. Based on the distribution of the data, a cutoff of 67.5 was used for Rab1A positivity. Tissue sections were examined and scored separately by two independent investigators blinded to the clinicopathologic data.\n\nCell lines and culture conditions {#s4_2}\n---------------------------------\n\nImmortalized bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and nine human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H1650, H1975, H2030, H292, H460, H838, SK-LU-1) were purchased from ATCC (American type culture collection). All cell lines were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination. BEAS-2B and H292 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\\'s Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A549, H1299, H1650, H1975, H2030, H460, H838 and SK-LU-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. All cell lines were maintained at 37°С in a 5% CO~2~ incubator. Cell lines were immediately expanded upon receipt and aliquots frozen to allow the cell lines to be restarted every three to four months from the same batch of cells. Cell phenotypes were verified in every experiment.\n\nsiRNA transfection {#s4_3}\n------------------\n\nSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting human Rab1A was synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China) and have been validated in our previous studies \\[[@R8]\\]. Sequences: Rab1A siRNA, AAU AAC UGG AGG UGA UUG UUC, Negative control siRNA: UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UTT. Transfections were performed on a panel of lung cancer cell lines. Cells were incubated with siRNA oligonucleotides and Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA) transfection reagent for 12 h. The cell culture medium was then replenished with fresh culture medium and the cells were analyzed.\n\nMTT assay {#s4_4}\n---------\n\nTo determine the effects of Rab1A knockdown, cell growth was analyzed using an MTT assay as previously described \\[[@R20]\\]. Cells were harvested 12 h post-transfection and re-seeded in 96-well plates at an initial density of 3 × 10^3^ cells/well. Assays were performed at 48 h post-seeding according to the manufacturer\\'s protocols. Data represent the mean ± SD (absorbance value at 490 nm) from three independent triplicate experiments.\n\nAntibodies and immunoblotting {#s4_5}\n-----------------------------\n\nCells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously \\[[@R8]\\]. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibody for Rab1A, Proteintech Group (Rosemont, IL); antibodies for P-S6K1(T398), S6K1, P-AKT(S473), AKT, P-ERK(T202/Y204), ERK, P-MK2(T334), MK2 and Tubulin, Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). HRP-labeled GAPDH, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). The EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosSTOP were obtained from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). All primary antibodies were confirmed to be reactive only to the targets by the manufacturer and used at 1:1000, and secondary antibodies were used at 1:10000. The data represent at least three independent experiments.\n\nStatistical analysis {#s4_6}\n--------------------\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20.0 software. The statistical analysis of numeration data was performed using Pearson\\'s chi-square test or Fisher\\'s exact chi-square test. The comparisons of continuous data between groups were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A nonparametric Spearman\\'s correlation test was performed to analyze the correlation between Rab1A and P-S6K1, P-AKT1, P-ERK, P-MK2 and P-c-Jun expression levels. All statistical tests were conducted at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.\n\n**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n**FUNDING**\n\nThis work was partially supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81572796 to F.L and 81672354 to Y.Z), Shanghai Pujiang Program (15PJ1404900 to Y.Z) and Foundation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (14XJ10036 to F.L).\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The United States is the best place to be a Muslim, according to William and Mary senior Madeeha Hameed (’09). Here, she said, there is freedom to worship as one chooses.\n\nHameed based her assessment on observations made during her recent tour of the United States as part of the “Journey into America” team that is documenting the Muslim experience. Having helped conduct interviews in more than 30 cities, Hameed said that stereotyped views of U.S. Muslims continue to shape the daily relationships among citizens. However, she said, “So many Muslims told me that there is no country they rather live in than America. … They believe you can be the truest Muslim in this country.”\n\nHameed found the cities of Detroit and New York to be the most oppressive for Muslims. “The moment you step foot into New York City, you could just feel the tension in that Muslim community to this day due to 9/11.” Even as the team, led by Akbar Ahmed, a celebrated Islamic scholar, entered mosques, they were questioned, “Are you from the CIA,” Hameed said.\n\nAs the only Muslim woman on the team, Hameed discovered that “in the field” her participation in discussion often was received through the filter of gender. For many of the individuals encountered, she was the first Muslim woman they had met. Although their reactions varied, Madeeha delighted in situations where she could serve as bridge spanning cultural gaps.\n\nThat ability, according to her William and Mary professor Tamara Sonn, the William R. Kenan Professor of Humanities, puts Hameed on the front lines of a more tolerant society. “Religious intolerance is a major problem,” Sonn said. “Intolerance often comes from fear. By learning about the religious other, the fear dissipates. It’s replaced by knowledge and understanding.” As tolerance is sought, Hameed serves an example that there are willing helpers in all religious communities, Sonn said.\n\nHameed's video footage already has helped people come to a greater appreciation of their Islamic neighbors as it has appeared on CNN. It also is likely to be used in upcoming documentaries being prodcued for the BBC and PBS.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nWhy does the order of the before_actions declaration matter?\n\nI am working through Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial. When doing Chapter 11, I updated the before_actions in the UserController and did not think the order mattered. So mine looked like this:\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :correct_user,   only: [:edit, :update]\n  before_action :admin_user,     only: :destroy\n  before_action :signed_in_user,\n            only: [:index, :edit, :update, :destroy, :following, :followers]\n\nHis looked like this:\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :signed_in_user,\n            only: [:index, :edit, :update, :destroy, :following, :followers]\n  before_action :correct_user,   only: [:edit, :update]\n  before_action :admin_user,     only: :destroy\n\nThe only difference is the order of the statements.\nWhen I run rspec on mine, I get four errors. But when I change the order, there are none. I don't see any dependence on the order of the declarations. I would like to know why the order matters.\nThat's my question... Here is more information about the code I am running. \nBecause I'm at the end of the book, there is a lot of code, so I will try to include the parts that I think could be relevant.\nTwo of the actions listed in the declarations are defined at the end of the same class:\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\n\n  before_action :correct_user,   only: [:edit, :update]\n  before_action :admin_user,     only: :destroy\n  before_action :signed_in_user,\n            only: [:index, :edit, :update, :destroy, :following, :followers]\n\n.\n.\n.\n  private\n\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password,\n                                 :password_confirmation)\n  end\n\n  #

The order of the declarations only affects the result of the tests. It took me a while to find this problem by going back over Hartl's code and making sure mine exactly reflected his. I found this order difference after a while and made the change, and suddenly my tests all passed. I've switched the order back and forth several times to make sure it is the order and only the order that is changing and that is making the difference. I'd like to understand so I'm not caught on a similiar problem when I am writing my own code rather than copying someone else's code.\n\nA:\n\nIt looks like in this controller, signed_in_user is acting as a guard to make sure that there is a valid current_user before proceeding (and if there isn't one, redirecting to the signin page, where one will be created).\nYour fourth test gives this away - admin? is undefined because admin_user was called before signed_in_user. When signed_in_user is called first, admin_user won't be called unless there is actually a valid current_user to call admin? on. So there actually is a dependency on the order of filters here - signed_in_user must be called first, because it ensures that there is a valid current_user, and the other filters assume that this has happened already.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Circuit designers of multi-Gigabit systems face a number of challenges as advances in technology mandate increased performance in high-speed components. At a basic level, data transmission between high-speed components within a single semiconductor device or between two devices on a printed circuit board may be represented by the system 10 shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, a transmitter 12 (e.g., a microprocessor) sends data over a transmission channel 14 (e.g., a copper trace on a printed circuit board or “on-chip” in a semiconductor device) to a receiver 16 (e.g., another processor or memory). When data is sent from an ideal transmitter 12 to a receiver 16 across an ideal (lossless) channel, all of the energy in a transmitted pulse will be contained within a single time cell, which is an example of a unit interval (UI).\nHowever, real transmitters and real transmission channels do not exhibit ideal characteristics, and the effects of transmission channels are becoming increasingly important in high-speed circuit design. Due to a number of factors, including, for example, the limited conductivity of copper traces, the dielectric medium of the printed circuit board (PCB), and the discontinuities introduced by vias, the initially well-defined digital pulse will end to spread or disperse as it passes over the transmission path. This is shown in FIG. 2. As shown, a single pulse of data 15a is sent by the transmitter 12 during a given UI (e.g., UI 3). However, because of the effect of the channel 14, this data pulse 15b becomes spread over multiple UIs at the receiver 16, i.e., some portion of the energy of the pulse is observed outside of the UI in which the pulse was sent (e.g., in UI 2 and UI 4). This residual energy outside of the UI of interest may perturb a pulse otherwise occupying either of the neighboring UIs in a phenomenon referred to as intersymbol interference (ISI).\nDue to several factors associated with the complexity in designing, building, and testing such circuitry, it is a common practice in the art of integrated circuit design to simulate the operation of a circuit using a computer system. Simulation software allows the circuit designer to verify the operation and margins of a circuit design before incurring the expense of actually building and testing the circuit. Simulation is particularly important in the semiconductor industry, where it is generally very expensive to design and produce a given integrated circuit. Through the use of simulations, design errors or risks are hopefully identified early in the design process, and resolved prior to fabrication.\nThe challenge associated with simulating channel-affected signals is highly correlated to the characteristics of the degradation imposed by the transmission channel. As will be discussed in greater detail, signals in any transmission medium experience both random and deterministic degradation. Random degradation, in the form of random Gaussian distributed voltage noise and timing noise (which is often referred to as “jitter”) stemming from thermal and shot noise, requires statistical quantification. Similarly, deterministic voltage noise and timing jitter are linked to several sources, including power supply noise, inter-channel crosstalk, impedance discontinuities, component variance, and at high frequencies the response of the channel, resulting in a variety of observable characteristics, from periodicity to uncorrelated-bounded randomness. To model these noise components correctly requires the ability to designate their probabilities during the noise generation stage and consequently apply or superimpose these effects onto the underlying signal in a way that reflects what occurs in the actual system. The final success or robustness of a particular design is dependent, to a large measure, on the achieved realism of the simulation environment. To date, industry standard simulators do not provide the level of noise and jitter generation control needed to accurately model a realistic communication link.\nAnother challenge simulating realistic signaling environments is tied to the underlying statistical assumption that sufficient samples of the behavior to be characterized are readily available. As such, it is becoming necessary to include more and more cycles with each simulation. At the same time, the relative size of each individual noise component, be it amplitude noise or timing jitter, is very small with respect to the overall signal amplitude and/or cycle period, implying that fine voltage and timing resolution are also necessary. When fine simulated resolution is coupled with a large number of simulated cycles, the result is an enormous amount of data and prohibitively lengthy simulation times. It is not uncommon for transistor-level transient (time-based) simulations to run for hours or even days. It is likewise not uncommon for such a simulation to fail due to a lack of memory resources.\nBecause simulation time and memory requirements associated with transistor level evaluation are prohibitive, a large portion of high-speed link design and verification is carried out at the system level with programs like Matlab. These tools allow the designer to take a more statistical look at the link behavior. Statistical models are often used to predict data eye closure at low bit error rates (BERs) because it is simply not practical to simulate to a standard BER, such as 1×10−12. Statistical simulation requires the circuit designer to make a number of assumptions, such as the noise characteristics of the power supply or reference voltage (Vref). Further, most statistical methods are based on the system pulse response, which is typically obtained through either the system impulse response or the system step response. One shortcoming of such an approach is that the measured system responses correspond to a specific circuit bias configuration, while the circuit biasing varies over time. Finally, and perhaps most restrictively, statistical analysis rests on the assumption of system linearity, while the majority of present-day systems still contain nonlinear elements.\nAt the lower data rates of the past, voltage noise was the dominant concern, leading to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boosting circuits like the matched filter and ISI canceling channel equalizers. But at multi-Gigabit/second (Gb/s) data-rates, the inherently short symbol period (i.e., unit interval (UI)) has shifted attention from voltage to time. And whereas noise budgets were once an essential part of the initial design specification, jitter budgets are now the more common focus. White this trend may appear to justify the independent analysis of amplitude noise and timing jitter when one of the two is the more dominant performance limiter, increased accuracy is still achieved when both noise components are considered simultaneously. Accordingly, an improved signal simulation technique would at least generate a full signal with both amplitude noise and timing jitter.\nAnother argument for developing full signals with amplitude noise and timing jitter, rather than maintaining independent noise and jitter models, is the impact of ISI. While unbounded Gaussian noise and jitter lead to long term bit errors, depending upon the bandwidth of the channel, ISI and the corresponding data-dependent jitter (DM) may dominate the short term signal degradation.\nFinally, to be able to incorporate the anticipated impact of the channel directly into the input stimulus waveform at the time of signal generation can reduce simulation time significantly, as the mathematical process for computing the impact of the channel on the signal (convolution) is computationally intensive. Therefore, it would benefit circuit designers to avoid repeating such a calculation with each simulation. The disclosed techniques achieve such results in a manner implementable in a typical computerized system or other computerized circuit simulation software package.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Elucidating the pH-Dependent Structural Transition of T7 Bacteriophage Endolysin.\nBacteriophages are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth. Bacteriophage endolysins are unique peptidoglycan hydrolases and have huge potential as effective enzybiotics in various infectious models. T7 bacteriophage endolysin (T7L), also known as N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase or T7 lysozyme, is a 17 kDa protein that lyses a range of Gram-negative bacteria by hydrolyzing the amide bond between N-acetylmuramoyl residues and the l-alanine of the peptidoglycan layer. Although the activity profiles of several of the T7 family members have been known for many years, the molecular basis for their pH-dependent differential activity is not clear. In this study, we explored the pH-induced structural, stability, and activity characteristics of T7L by applying a variety of biophysical techniques and protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our studies established a reversible structural transition of T7L below pH 6 and the formation of a partially denatured conformation at pH 3. This low-pH conformation is thermally stable and exposed its hydrophobic pockets. Further, NMR relaxation measurements and structural analysis unraveled that T7L is highly dynamic in its native state and a network of His residues are responsible for the observed pH-dependent conformational dynamics and transitions. As bacteriophage chimeric and engineered endolysins are being developed as novel therapeutics against multiple drug resistance pathogens, we believe that our results are of great help in designing these entities as broadband antimicrobial and/or antibacterial agents.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Winners\n\nAyoze Perez, the worker bee\n\nIf we piled the praise on Salomon Rondon last week for making this Newcastle system work, Perez can probably claim to be Rafael Benitez’s perfect player. He’s Spanish, he didn’t cost much, he’s an incredibly hardworking forward and, most crucially, he’s desperate to learn. If Benitez had ten Ayoze Perez’s, he’d probably pick seven or eight of them.\n\nPerez tops this list because he scored a hat-trick and reached ten league goals in a season for the first time in English football. At 25, he is wiser than his years. The finishing and final ball can be frustrating, a point on which many Newcastle fans would agree, but both are improving all the time. In any case, those flaws can also be overlooked when you drill down into Perez’s contribution to Benitez’s style.\n\nHere are the top five attacking players in the Premier League ranked by tackles made:\n\nAyoze Pérez – 59\n\nRicharlison – 47\n\nWilfried Zaha – 38\n\nJunior Hoilett – 35\n\nJordan Ayew – 34\n\nAnd here are the top five attacking players in the Premier League ranked by interceptions made:\n\nAyoze Pérez – 42\n\nJunior Hoilett – 30\n\nRaul Jimenez – 23\n\nPedro – 18\n\nTheo Walcott – 18\n\nAnd let’s do the tackles and interceptions combined:\n\nAyoze Pérez – 101\n\nJunior Hoilett – 65\n\nRicharlison – 62\n\nRaul Jimenez – 50\n\nSadio Mane – 49\n\nThe gap between Perez and second place is equal to the gap between second and 19th. No wonder Benitez loves him so.\n\nRafael Benitez\n\nNewcastle United suffered a rotten start to 2018/19, with Rondon not fully fit and the mood of gloom that tends to follow every unpleasant summer transfer window affecting their autumn. But since the beginning of November, only Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have taken more league points. Given the size and strength of their squad, that is a remarkable feat.\n\nSo give Benitez what he wants, Newcastle, or risk alienating the club’s support even more than you already have. Benitez is perhaps not blameless in this cat-and-mouse game of politics, but he at least has the mandate of the people and the corroborative evidence that he deserves the trust and financial support of his club.\n\nThe myth is that Benitez wants hundreds of millions of pounds; that’s a nonsense. What he wants is enough money to improve this squad and thus give them realistic hope of challenging for the top seven. It’s less about the amount of money, and more about the power to bring in players that he wants if he is to commit to the long term rather than having Lee Charnley choose them. You can see why he might be wary of signing up for something and seeing it shift in front of his eyes before the ink is dry. This is Mike Ashley, after all.\n\nIf Newcastle get this wrong, they deserve their supporters to leave in droves – and they will. Benitez has proven that he can keep Newcastle’s head above water despite being thrown in at the deep end with his hands and feet tied together. That has only opened the eyes of supporters to what he could make of this club if everyone was pulling in the same direction.\n\nJurgen Klopp\n\nOf course it was only Cardiff, who have now lost all 11 games against top-six opposition this season. Manchester City’s victory over Tottenham means that even three points away from home makes this weekend a backwards step for Liverpool in their pursuit of the title, which demonstrates just how ridiculous this two-way fight has become.\n\nBut this was still a landmark victory for Klopp, because it took Liverpool to their highest ever Premier League points total with three games still remaining. Now all thoughts turn to Old Trafford on Wednesday, and their hated rivals potentially doing them an extraordinary favour.\n\nPhil Foden\n\nLove him, love him, love him. Kevin de Bruyne’s latest setback, just when he was back in full stride, is a bloody shame, but if it means we see more of Foden then I’m still happy. It doesn’t matter that he’s still only 18; he’s good enough to play at this level and therefore he needs the regular minutes that will ensure his development. A second Premier League start and first goal are good steps, but I’ll make no apologies for demanding more.\n\nNow go and read 16 Conclusions from the Etihad.\n\nEverton’s defence\n\nThe home victory over Chelsea was Marco Silva’s watershed victory as Everton manager, but it has given him a taste for humbling the big clubs. The supporters are firmly back on his side.\n\nAfter scoring four times against a ‘big’ club (loose-ish definition, but 4-0 vs Manchester City in January 2017 and 4-4 vs Leeds in October 1999, who finished third that season) for the third time in almost 20 years, you might think that the focus would be on Everton’s attack. Indeed, you would struggle to find a team that scored three better goals in a game anywhere in the world this weekend than Everton’s first three.\n\nBut given that the doubts over Silva lay in his defensive organisation, that is where we must direct our praise. In their last four home games, Everton have kept clean sheets against Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal. That has been achieved not through defensive grit, but playing on the front foot and using Lucas Digne and Seamus Coleman to pin back opposition full-backs.\n\nFor too long Everton were passive against the biggest and best, as if spooked by their quality. Now, it is Everton who have given the opposition something to think about. Improve their sloppiness against the bottom half, particularly away from home, and they can make a move on the top six next season.\n\nScott Parker\n\nThe first Fulham manager to record consecutive Premier League clean sheets since Martin Jol. The first Fulham manager to win consecutive Premier League games since Felix Magath. The first Fulham manager to win an away Premier League game since Felix Magath.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Parker will hope to leave a slightly better legacy than a lingering cheesy smell on Brede Hangeland’s thigh, but he is certainly maturing on the job.\n\nBrighton, who went back to what works\n\nA hard-earned point that might just stop the Brighton rot, but one gained in interesting circumstances. There have been rumours both that Chris Hughton will leave at the end of this season and that the players have been unhappy with Brighton’s negative tactics. At Wolves on Saturday, Hughton doubled down on his own plan and finally got some joy.\n\nWhat was most striking about Brighton’s draw was the team that Hughton picked to start the match. It was a complete 2017/18 XI, with Yves Bissouma not even on the bench and none of Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Bernardo, Florin Andone or Jurgen Locadia starting.\n\nGiven the heart and fight displayed to grind out a vital point, Hughton will consider that his plan worked perfectly (although Wolves did merit victory). But it does raise questions about the players who joined the club last summer, and gives weight to the theory that there are cliques within this squad that have dragged down their performance level this season. Confirm their survival, and those issues must be addressed.\n\nWilfried Zaha, moving on up\n\nA bad week for Crystal Palace, given Zaha’s interview in which he made it clear that he is seeking the Champions League football that Palace will be unable to provide.\n\nYou can’t really blame him. Zaha has played 300 career league games, 286 of which have been for Palace. His style might be more suited to being the big fish in small pond, where he can get plenty of the ball and responsibility and play on the counter, but he deserves the chance to test himself at the very highest level. Watching him give Mohamed Elneny and Shkodran Mustafi twisted blood was a sport in itself.\n\nCrystal Palace’s away form\n\nA weird old season. Palace rank 19th in the Premier League for their home record, but sixth for their away record. They have now won twice as many games on the road than at Selhurst Park this season and scored more than twice as many goals. The number of times Palace have scored more than twice at home in the league this season? None. The number of times they have done it away? Five, and that includes Manchester City, Leicester City and now Arsenal.\n\nGerard Deulofeu\n\nForgive me for the cynicism, but you do wonder whether Deulofeu might try and engineer a move to a bigger club this summer, and whether this run of form coincides with that mission.\n\nDeulofeu has eight goals and two assists in his last nine matches in all competitions, making him one of the form players in the Premier League. Still only 25, and having started matches for Barcelona last season, he may have an eye on Champions League football in 2019/20.\n\nChristian Benteke\n\nHis first goal of any kind for 358 days. Truly a Christian resurrection on Easter Sunday that people of any faith can get behind.\n\nLosers\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United\n\nThe worst performance ever by Manchester United in the Premier League? Perhaps. There must be an honourable mention for the 5-0 defeat to Newcastle in 1996, but the Magpies were a very good side and the same applies to the 6-1 defeat to Manchester City and 5-0 shellacking by Chelsea in 2000. The 3-1 and 6-3 defeats to Southampton were humiliating, but at least United scored. The 4-1 loss at Middlesbrough in 2005 was awful, as were the losses to promoted teams last season.\n\nLet’s settle for calling this dismal, wretched and miserable. When David Moyes was asked in the studio for his take on the defeat at Goodison, he could not resist a jab to the ribs. “Folk might go back to some of my performances with United, but I’ve got to say I hope I wasn’t as bad as that,” he said. Ouch.\n\nFirstly, those who will use this as a means of absolving Jose Mourinho of blame are mistaken. After all, it was he who damaged the morale of many of these players and he who spent £360m on a squad that still looks painfully light on quality. Solskjaer admitted after United’s Champions League exit that his squad were two levels below Barcelona, but it is defeats against the likes of Everton that paint a far more depressing picture. On this evidence, United are miles below the quality required to compete at the very top domestically.\n\nThe players deserve plenty of censure too. Solskjaer promised after the game that there had to be an improvement in the basics and in the fitness of his players, and it is likely that plenty in his squad must suffer a period of introspection or risk being left behind. There will need to be tough decisions made on those who have been loyal to the club but are simply of insufficient quality to stay.\n\nBut Solskjaer will also know that, even this early into his permanent tenure, the pressure is on him and the tide of opinion is shifting on his credentials. Having succeeded as a caretaker with a double dose of positivity and a large sprinkling of nostalgia, the Norwegian is learning the hard way that succeeding at an elite club requires managerial techniques that are a little more tangible. The ‘I remember in 1999’ schtick carries no weight anymore. We said it with Mourinho and we’ll say it with him: these are not all bad players, just ones who succeeded elsewhere and look lame at Old Trafford. It is the manager’s job to address that.\n\nPart of Solskjaer’s success depends on the strength of his character in motivating senior players and forcing through the necessary change of structure at the top of the club; fail in either and he will fail on the pitch. But we also need to see a tactical plan that involves United playing on the front foot, digging in when necessary and getting the best out of highly-paid key players.\n\nSolskjaer deserves until next season for us to make our definitive judgement on his suitability for this job. It would be unfair to call him a dud based on such a short period and without a transfer window to address some of the obvious flaws in the squad.\n\nBut at this rate, Solskjaer will be starting next season in deficit and in the Europa League, and United seem to be a club without a long-term manager or long-term plan. If you’re a superstar footballer looking for a big-money move this summer, how many clubs in Europe would appear above United in your list of attractive destinations?\n\nFred, truly Mr Manchester United\n\nYou could not paint a better picture of United’s last five years than a £52m central midfielder signed at a grossly inflated price just to stop their rivals buying him, who then turns out to be entirely unfit for purpose and thus becomes a fringe player within six months, meaning they need to buy another player in a similar position for a similar price a year later. That’s what happens when you don’t plan properly.\n\nAnthony Martial\n\nI don’t want to get all Proper Football Man here, but he just never, ever looks arsed. That’s fine when he’s doing beautiful things in the final third, but on Sunday Martial might as well have not been on the pitch.\n\nShkodran Mustafi\n\nFor the first goal, Mustafi left Christian Benteke in five yards of space from a simple free-kick cross rather than tracking him. For the second goal, Mustafi saw that Bernd Leno wasn’t coming for the ball and must have felt Zaha putting pressure on him from behind, yet still decided to stop running and thus allow Zaha to run past him and score. For the third goal, Mustafi was one of three Arsenal players who failed to pick up their man at a Palace corner, and was left appealing for offside after the visitors scored.\n\nHe’s just not good enough, a bad joke that only gets less funny through the sheer number of times that you see it performed. The sooner Arsenal can move him out of the team, the quicker they will find the defensive resilience to facilitate sustainable progress. Until then, the timebomb will continue to tick.\n\nIt’s an anecdote I’ve used elsewhere this weekend, so apologies for the repetition, but after 85 minutes on Sunday Mustafi was shown a yellow card for diving, having overrun the ball when stepping out of defence. One Arsenal supporter in front of the press box stood up, as if to harangue referee Jon Moss. But no.\n\n“Send him off ref,” the fan shouted.”Show him a red; get rid of him.” There’s your perfect 12-word review.\n\nUnai Emery, sending the wrong message\n\nI understand why managers rest players, but sometimes they really do over-think it. Lucas Torreira, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Alex Iwobi might be fatigued (though they haven’t played much recently), but it was surely better to pick them for the visit of Crystal Palace than to call on Mohamed Elneny, Carl Jenkinson and play a back three including Mustafi and Konstantinos Mavropanos?\n\nArsenal are poor away from home, so this was the banker. Beat Palace and, with Tottenham and Manchester United both losing, Arsenal had one hand on Champions League football next season. But by picking a second string team and handing the initiative to Palace, Emery has given Arsenal a headache. They must now win at Wolves in midweek to wrestle back that crucial momentum.\n\nWolves\n\nA season now in serious danger of petering out, largely thanks to some dreadful away form. Since beating Bristol City in the FA Cup in February, Wolves have played Bournemouth, Huddersfield, Chelsea, Burnley, Watford and Southampton away from Molineux. They have drawn two and lost the other four.\n\nThat run increases the pressure on Wolves’ home form, and reduces the margin for error. Before Saturday, they had won seven of their last eight at home, atoning for the problems experienced on the road. But by failing to take their chances against Brighton on Saturday, Wolves drifted to 15/8 to finish in the top seven. Watford are now considered far more likely to pip them in the final straight, just as they did in the FA Cup semi-final. That will leave Nuno irritable for most of the summer.\n\nBournemouth, drifting again\n\nWe need to do little more than echo the post-match thoughts of Ryan Fraser:\n\n“When we’re good we always say ‘let’s back it up’ – and then we lose the next week. We need to get to grips with it. I think it’s mentality, I think we go into games thinking it’s too easy. That’s our season summed up: good one week and then a shambles the next.”\n\nIf Fraser is right, and Bournemouth are indeed going into matches believing they are too easy, Eddie Howe must spend the summer ridding the club of that unacceptable attitude. Bournemouth may well be a consistent Premier League presence now, but things can quickly change if complacency festers. They can and should take nothing for granted.\n\nDaniel Storey", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "\"Warren Buffett didn’t switch from buying net-nets to buying Coca-Cola (KO) merely because he decided investing in big, high-quality companies was a better way to make money than net-net investing. He did it because he had too much money. And because stock prices had gone up since the 1950s. But mostly because he had too much money.\"\n\nI agree that the size of funds with which Buffett is working would make net-net investing very difficult, but Warren's comments in his 1989 shareholder letter seem to contradict the idea that he \"didn't switch from buying net-nets...because he decided investing in big, high quality businesses was a better way to make money...\" Indeed, he says:\n\n\"If you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives you a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-term performance of the business may be terrible. I call this the 'cigar butt' approach to investing...Unless you are a liquidator that kind of approach to buying businesses is foolish. First, the original 'bargain' price probably will not turn out to be such a steal after all. In a difficult business, no sooner is one problem solved than another surfaces - never is there just one cockroach in the kitchen. Second, any initial advantage you secure will be quickly eroded by the low return that the business earns...Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre...It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"\n\nI know Buffett has stated that if he were working with smaller funds, he would be investing in much smaller companies than those in which he invests today...However, in his comments above, he seems to be making a clear argument against a net-net strategy...is he really advising against net-nets?\n\nBest,\n\nKeith\n\n*\n\nThat’s a great question. And a tricky one.\n\nLet’s start with the easy part. If Warren Buffett had $1 million to invest and he had to choose from companies like Coca-Cola in every respect or like net-nets in every respect, which would he buy?\n\nI think he’d buy net-nets. But that’s a false choice. The issue with companies like Coca-Cola (KO) is that they are bigger and trade at higher prices than net-nets. Both of these are disadvantages when working with small sums of money.\n\nSo why is it a false choice?\n\nBecause what Warren Buffett likes about net-nets is that they are super cheap relative to a conservative estimate of their value to a private owner.\n\nBut he hates the fact most net-nets are bad businesses.\n\nThe answer: buy better businesses that are also super cheap relative to a conservative estimate of their value to a private owner.\n\nThe best way to answer this question is to go straight to Warren Buffett. You quoted a letter Warren Buffett wrote to his shareholders in 1989. I’ll quote the answer Warren Buffett gave some University of Kansas students in 2005.\n\nHere’s the question he was asked: “…you were quoted as saying ‘it’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.’ First, would you say the same thing today? Second, since that statement (implies) that you would invest in smaller companies, other than investing in small caps, what else would you do differently?”\n\n“Yes, I would still say the same thing today. In fact, we are still earning those type of returns on some of our smaller investments. The best decade was the 1950s; I was earning 50% plus returns with small amounts of capital. I could do the same thing today with smaller amounts. It would perhaps even be easier to make that much money in today’s environment because information is easier to access.”\n\nSo, let’s talk about what I underlined there. Two points:\n\n1. “We are still earning those types of returns on some of our smaller investments.”\n\n2. “The best decade was the 1950s.”\n\nWell, Coca-Cola is a big company. And Buffett isn’t earning 50% a year on it. It’s been closer to 15% a year. So, if you want to mimic Warren Buffett – apparently you should pay attention to Berkshire’s smaller positions.\n\nWe actually have a few clues here. One, Buffett has bought things that aren’t stocks. He could make higher annual returns on smaller amounts of money in those without us knowing about it. He mentioned high yield bonds in several places. Berkshire did well on its junk bond investments in 2002. We can assume he would make more investments like those if he had less money – he often had to buy baskets of bonds rather than the single most attractive issue.\n\nTwo, Buffett has said that unleveraged returns on arbitrage at Graham-Newman averaged 20% a year from 1926 to 1956. And that Buffett did even better in arbitrage for his partnership and for Berkshire. It’s also worth mentioning that Buffett was willing to leverage up an arbitrage position in his partnership – but not a general holding. He thought a 1 to 1 ratio of borrowed money was appropriate as long as the partnership did not borrow more than 25% of its equity and the borrowing was only used in connection with special situations like arbitrage – not buying a stock like American Express, Disney, etc.\n\nIf you watch Berkshire’s holding very, very carefully over the years – you’ll see some arbitrage positions and “workouts” appear in there. Off the top of my head I can mention the Dow Jones position Berkshire took in 2007 before Rupert Murdoch’s acquisition was complete. So, it was a bet on the deal going through at a higher price than Buffett paid. Buffett didn’t like the newspaper business at the time. Dow Jones was an arbitrage position pure and simple. And then Comdisco was a liquidation. This sort of thing is not new. Back in the 1977 letter to shareholders you can see Buffett owned shares of two different “Kaiser” companies – Kaiser Industries, and Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical . They were originally one company. And plans for the break-up of the company had been discussed extensively in newspapers. I’m sure Buffett was reading those papers. And I’m sure that’s why he bought Kaiser.\n\nBuffett also mentions buying a stock after an announced event – something that appears in a newspaper as more than just a rumor – but before a deal is agreed to. He gives one specific example in his letter to partners. And he suggests there were more such situations over the years.\n\nSo, if we figure Warren Buffett can make more than 20% a year on his arbitrage positions without using leverage – and we figure he’d be willing to leverage up his arbitrage positions if he were working with small sums of his own money – you can see how we are now a lot closer to Buffett’s 50% a year returns than the 15% a year type returns a long-term blue chip investment like Coca-Cola can offer.\n\nLet’s get back to exactly what Warren Buffett said to those University of Kansas students in 2005:\n\n“You have to turn over a lot of rocks to find those little anomalies. You have to find the companies that are off the map – way off the map. You may find local companies that have nothing wrong with them at all. A company that I found, Western Insurance Securities, was trading for $3 a share when it was earning $20 a share! I tried to buy up as much of it as possible. No one will tell you about these businesses. You have to find them.”\n\nAnd that’s what I suggest folks who are really obsessed with value investing do. If this is your passion, then find those off the map companies. I’ve tried to talk about off the map companies as much as possible.\n\nIt’s not easy because:\n\n1. They’re illiquid\n\n2. People prefer reading about companies they’ve heard of\n\nThose are just the facts. And, at the end of the day, I write articles for people who read them. If folks have trouble buying the stock – that’s a problem. And if they’re totally uninterested in the subject matter – that’s an even bigger problem.\n\nBut I’ve always made it clear that obscure stocks are the way to go. If you have the drive to go out there and find stuff nobody knows about – do it.\n\nI’m 50% in Japanese net-nets right now, because you can make a lot in Japanese net-nets. I found a handful of companies over there that are just far, far cheaper than anything over here. And last year most of them went nowhere for me but one of them got bought out. I more than doubled my money on the one that got bought out. And I was invested in the company for less than a year. I don’t even want to mention the kind of annualized returns you get on a stock like that. They’re insanely high. And basically one net-net that gets bought out like that can pay for 4 net-nets that do nothing for a year.\n\nBut if I write about a stock that is in the Dow Jones Industrial Average – more people will want to read that article than read about Japanese net-nets. One of those two articles can make you buckets of money. The other can’t. (What can I possibly know about a Dow 30 company that a hundred and six big fund managers don’t already know?) More people will probably read the article that can’t make you money.\n\nVery few people who read this article now we’ll go look at Japanese net-nets because of it. That’s the way it was when Ben Graham got started in investing, that’s the way it was when Warren Buffett got started in investing, and that’s still the way it is today.\n\nIt’s amazing how little use we make of our good ideas.\n\nThere are lots of stocks nobody looks at. There are a few stocks everybody looks at. It doesn’t make sense. But that’s the way it is.\n\nI’ve talked about Bancinsurance. I posted an article here about my experience with that stock. Before I wrote that article, I don’t think the Bancinsurance story was very well known. The stock certainly didn’t trade much. And I ended up making a very high rate of return on that investment. Now, the problem with both Sanjo Machine Works (in Japan last year) and Bancinsurance (in the U.S. back in 2010) was that you had to work very, very hard to get shares.\n\nYes, it’s a slight inconvenience. Bidding for illiquid stocks isn’t my favorite thing to do. But it’s hardly 40 hours of back breaking work a week. And if you do it right, it pays better.\n\nBack to something like Bancinsurance or Sanjo…\n\nFirst, some people just see it is super thinly traded and give up. If you’re someone with millions and millions of dollars to invest – that’s the right call. I’m not someone with millions of dollars to invest. So, I just went out and tried to buy every share of those companies I could.\n\nThey are really very boring stories. Both of them. There isn’t much t them. Sanjo was trading at a huge discount to net cash. And it wasn’t historically a money losing business. You could liquidate it for more than 2 times what I paid for the stock. Bancinsurance was an insurance company that was worth book value – it had a combined ratio under 100 in 28 of the last 30 years – that was selling for about 55% of book value. I was familiar with the company from a few years back when it looked cheap, but I didn’t buy shares then. So, yes, I had a small advantage in that I try to know a little bit about any decent over the counter companies I come across and keep them in the back of my mind. Anyone can create that advantage for themselves with a few hours of work a week dedicated to the pink sheets.\n\nI started buying at $4.75 a share – book value was somewhere around $8.50 and it was worth book to a private owner – but I didn’t get very far. The CEO announced he was offering to buyout the company at $6 a share. That was clearly too low. So, from that point on I bought every single share I could get my hands on. The weird thing is that I was able to get my hands on any of the shares – and at $6 a share!\n\nThat’s the strange part of these stories. Not that so few shares trade in these stocks – that’s totally understandable. The unbelievable part is that someone was selling Sanjo at no more than half of its liquidation value. And someone was selling Bancinsurance at something like a 30% discount to book value – at the exact price the controlling shareholder was offering! I mean, someone will sell shares in a company to you that’s clearly undervalued and won’t even ask for a penny more than a control buyer is offering.\n\nWell, the deal might fall through?\n\nSure. I totally considered that possibility. And I said to myself – worst case scenario: “You own a decent company at a very low price. Best case: you get bought out.” The downside in this stock was about what the upside is in most stocks – you get a decent business at a cheap price but you don’t have a catalyst.\n\nAnd yet someone sold under those circumstances.\n\nIt’s mind boggling. But it happens. My average cost in that stock was $5.82 a share. If anything, I was probably too stingy. Maybe offering just a smidge more than the CEO’s offer would’ve sent a few more shares my way. I can dream.\n\nThe big thing is just that when you find a situation like Sanjo or Bancinsurance you have to go out and just buy up the shares. You don’t think about “your portfolio” and how you are allocated and whether you are getting the exact perfect price and maybe it will trade down a bit and I can get a lower average cost and – no, wrong answer.\n\nThe right answer: buy.\n\nAnd that’s how you make 50% a year annual returns. Now, I’m someone telling you that who has not earned 50% a year.\n\nThat’s a huge reason why I’m reluctant to hold too many small positions. My returns in the couple stocks a year where I was willing to buy without regard to portfolio weight – like Bancinsurance – have been on the level of those 50% returns. They’ve been extraordinary.\n\nThe problem…\n\nMy other decisions – the majority of my decisions which end up being 10% positions and so on – they have been utterly unremarkable. Japan is an exception, because I never thought of it as one position. It was a basket that I think of as a 50% position.\n\nBut basically I’ve made maybe 10 important investment decisions in the 12 plus years I’ve been investing – everything else was a wash. And probably a waste of time. Other than those 10 decisions, I would’ve been better off just holding cash and then adding that cash when the next unbelievably obvious investment idea came around.\n\nAnyway, my point is that you should listen to Warren Buffett when he says these things. Because they are still around. Obscure stocks where you can make a lot of money for just using a tiny bit of common sense – they are around in 2012. They are rare. And you can’t go around buying one of these a month. You have to look where no one else is looking, you have to be satisfied with literally a couple great ideas a year, and then you have to just gobble up shares when you find an “anomaly”. Because that’s the right word for these things. They don’t make sense. They are beyond “a cheap stock”. They are just so clearly and bizarrely mispriced that you do feel as if someone just walked up to you and offered to sell you a dollar bill for 50 cents. Every time someone offers to sell you feel that way.\n\nAnd there’s another stock I don’t want to keep mentioning – I’ve mentioned it a lot in the past, it was a net-net and a net cash stock when I bought it, but it is no longer – because it’s one of my favorite stocks in the whole world but it’s also super illiquid so we’ll get to the point where if you Google Search for this stock you’ll just get me yapping about it in 100 different articles.\n\nSo, the stock will go nameless. But the numbers and emotions are exactly true.\n\nAnyway, I was trying to buy this stock that shall not be named (check my past articles – you’ll know it when you see it) and it traded maybe something like 1,000 shares a day on average. No more than that. I wanted 20 times the daily volume. And I had heard this stock was impossible to get – or at least some folks had put in orders that didn’t get filled. So, I’m preparing myself psychologically for not getting any shares.\n\nNow, to set the scene, the stock is selling for net cash. This is a good business. I won’t bore you with the details. But it’s been profitable more than 90% of the time for the last couple decades, it’s got a free cash flow margin around 20%, and return on invested capital is very high. Without leverage, this company would be earning more than a 30% return on equity after-tax.\n\nOf course, it isn’t. It’s earning a tiny ROE because it has a balance sheet overloaded with cash. The company has like 4 times more cash than all its other assets. I call this anti-leverage. I’m sure I stole the term from somebody else. But, basically, when a really good company has invested assets that are less than its book value you end up with anti-leverage. The business earns a 30% return on equity. But most of the company’s cash isn’t in the business. It’s sitting idle. So, the stated ROE drops to 10% or 5% or something utterly unremarkable. And so this stocks drops off the radar for folks who like to invest in lovely little companies. Everybody knows who earns 30% returns on equity.\n\nIf you say “small company, high ROE”, in a second I’m saying:\n\n· United Guardian (UG)\n\n· Utah Medical Products (UTMD)\n\n· Psychemedics (PMD)\n\nI’ve never owned those companies. I’m not an expert on them. They aren’t in the top few hundred companies I know best. But I know their names.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they are small and have earned high returns on equity. That’s a good group of companies to know. And it’s really easy to screen for.\n\nBut if a company uses anti-leverage. If it becomes a giant cash pile it can drop off some of those screens.\n\nSo this company had no catalyst, didn’t do anything with its cash, and it will also connected to residential housing – which in 2010 was not the place to be.\n\nSo there are reasons why people wouldn’t want to buy the stock when I was looking at it. But why exactly would someone sell the stock? That part still baffles me.\n\nBut to really set the scene you have to understand the company is buying back shares. Not just this quarter or last quarter or last year – they’ve been doing this for a decade. It’s not a big amount of shares relative to the market cap. But it’s big relative to the float. And it’s huge relative to what actually trades. And they aren’t issuing stock. Literally every single year they end up with an equal or lesser amount of shares.\n\nFor a company that trades below cash to be doing this – flashing lights need to go off or something to alert you to a stock like that. Because chances are it belongs near the top of your list of stocks to consider buying. A net cash stock that is paying a dividend and buying back shares is usually a stock you want to buy.\n\nOkay. So, we’re back in 2010. The stock is now trading at net cash. When I say net cash I actually mean a mix of mutual funds, municipal bonds, etc. Also, they have like a million dollars in a local bank. Anyway, so we are at net cash and I get most my shares over a long period of time around there. But what’s interesting – baffling really – is that at about 35 cents over net cash something like 100,000 shares trades. More than that maybe. We’re talking something like 5% of the shares not in the hands of the controlling family.\n\nNow, you’re thinking that’s understandable. The company was trading above net cash. It’s totally illiquid. All these things are true.\n\nBut let me tell you what the company earned in 2010:\n\n30 cents a share. And they paid 17 cents a share in dividends.\n\nSo, someone sold over 5% of the non-family controlled portion of the company for net cash plus 1.16 times earnings and net cash plus 2 times dividends.\n\nIn fiscal 2011, they earned 40 cents a share and the dividend was 20 cents.\n\nThis year – their fiscal year ends early in the calendar year – they’re on track for about 50 cents in earnings and 23 cents in dividends.\n\nAnd someone was willing to sell what – for that company – was a really big block of the tradeable stock for just the company’s cash and investment plus 35 cents.\n\nThat’s the part that I don’t understand. I never believe it until I see it. But there are still companies that trade for as much as they’d be worth in liquidation. They’re off the map. Way off the map. But they’re out there. And sometimes, you’ll suddenly be offered $500,000 worth of their stock. And you don’t know that until you find the stock and go out there and bid for it. You could never guess anyone would offer to sell at that price. But it happens.\n\nHere’s Warren Buffett talking to those same University of Kansas students:\n\n“Other examples: Genesee Valley Gas, public utility trading at a P/E of 2, GEICO, Union Street Railway of New Bedford selling at $30 when $100 a share is sitting in cash, high yield position in 2002. No one will tell you about these ideas, you have to find them.”\n\n“I know more about business and investing today, but my returns have continued to decline since the 50s.”\n\nBuffett knows not to buy Hochschild Kohn today. He knows to buy Coca-Cola instead. He knows the importance of good management. If he had it to do over – do you think he ever would have sold out of Capital Cities the first time he owned the stock?\n\nWould he have sold out of Disney if he had it to do over again?\n\nWould he have sold out of American Express?\n\nWould he have bought Berkshire Hathway?\n\nRemember, Buffett didn’t completely liquidate his partnership. In a sense, he sold out of shares of companies like American Express and Disney and kept shares of Berkshire Hathaway. Yeah. I don’t think he’d make that choice again.\n\nNo. He would’ve used insurance companies as a source of investable cash and he would’ve bought and held wonderful businesses like Walt Disney, American Express, and Capital Cities.\n\nBut would that have earned Buffett the kinds of returns he made in the 1950s?\n\nNo.\n\nYou can be really dumb about a lot of things when you’re managing millions of dollars that you can’t be dumb about when you’re managing billions of dollars. Managing small sums of money really depends on just being smart about a couple things.\n\nDoes that mean you have to invest in net-nets if you are working with small sums of money?\n\nNo. In fact, if it’s against your nature to invest in net-nets – steer clear, you’ll find a way to screw it up.\n\nCan you beat investing in net-nets? Is there another way to compound small sums of money at really high annual returns?\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut, you have to remember, there are different kinds of net-nets. We aren’t saying you have to buy the worst businesses in the world. Just the cheapest.\n\nBuffett explicitly said to the University of Kansas students in 2005 that he would buy things like Union Street Railway. Well, Union Street Railway was a declining business. Societal changes were definitely going against the company.\n\nBut it had $100 in cash and you could buy it for $30.\n\nBuffett would buy a mix of companies. I’m not saying he would just buy net-nets. But he would just buy insanely cheap stocks like:\n\n· Genesee Valley Gas\n\n· Union Street Railway\n\n· GEICO\n\n· Western Securities\n\nAnd so on. He’s talking about either a growth company like GEICO trading like a value investment, or stocks trading at P/E ratios in the low single digits, or stocks trading for less than their net cash.\n\nHe’s not talking about Coca-Cola.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy stocks like Coca-Cola. But, if you do, you need to lower your expectations.\n\nYou’re going to make a lot closer to 15% a year doing a great job of picking high quality companies. Even if you do everything right – in that kind of investing – you’re not going to make 50% a year.\n\nThat’s fine. If you can save and make 15% on those savings, you’ll retire just fine.\n\nBut if you want to become a billionaire you probably shouldn’t start with Coca-Cola. You should start with those little market anomalies Warren Buffett told the University of Kansas students about.\n\nBuffett advice of thinking about 20-punch card when buying stock almost recommends KO style investment - buy a high quality company with a margin of safety and ideally never sell. For me, it is not a net-net investment style.\n\nAgree with Geoff. Noone is going to make 50% returns buying stocks on an intrinsic value basis. You need to be looking for companies where the 50% (or more) upside is clearly visible on the balance sheet.\n\nThis can take you into some strange territory where growth rates, PE ratios, and other standard metrics have no relevance.\n\nYou'd be more likely to wind up researching legal precedents for a stock where value is tied up in litigation (see GYRO), or researching the market values for relics that were recovered from the Titanic (see PXRI). These opportunities are out there, but not for those looking for stocks that are undervalued purely on an IV basis.\n\nDisclaimers: GuruFocus.com is not operated by a broker, a dealer, or a registered investment adviser.

{"text": "Aging increases cytochrome P450 4A modulation of alpha1-adrenergic vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries.\nAging is associated with peripheral vascular dysfunction. In vascular smooth muscle, cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) enzymes form the vasoconstrictor 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). 20-HETE acts as an intracellular messenger to modulate vasoconstriction induced by various agonists, including the alpha1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Eicosanoids produced by CYP4A contribute to the elevated vascular tone in hypertension, but the effects of advanced age on CYP4A modulation of vasoconstriction are unknown. Mesenteric arteries were isolated from young (3 to 4 months) and aged (17 to 18 months) Sprague-Dawley rats. Vasoconstriction was induced with PE or ET-1 in the absence or presence of the CYP4A inhibitor DDMS and/or the ETA inhibitor BQ123. CYP4A inhibition with DDMS significantly reduced PE sensitivity in aged rats, but it had no effect in young. Furthermore, in aged rats only, ETA inhibition reduced PE sensitivity while combined inhibition of CYP4A and ETA had no additional effect, suggesting that the pathways work in concert in aging. Exogenous ET-1 constriction was not altered by DDMS in young or aged rats. Overall, our data indicate that aging increases the contribution of CYP4A to alpha1-adrenergic vasoconstriction in systemic arteries. Understanding aging-related changes in vascular function is important for development of novel targets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Often, a user of a DVR device may find that a recorded program lacks desirable recording attributes. For example, the recorded program may have been interrupted, it may be missing the beginning or the end of the program, it may have incorrect content, or it may lack some other desirable recording attribute. As another example, the DVR device may direct a tuner that is recording a program to stop recording the program and record another, higher priority program. In some embodiments, the DVR may record an analog transmission of a program instead of a digital or high-definition transmission of the program, which the user finds more desirable. If the user needs to see the program before the next transmission time, the user is left with a program lacking desirable recording attributes and no easy means of acquiring a suitable copy.\nAccordingly, it would be desirable to provide video recording systems and methods for recording multiple copies of a program to attempt to ensure that the user will have a copy of the program for playback which does not lack desirable recording attributes.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to digging and levelling apparatus such as draglines, backhoes, front-end loaders and like equipment and more particularly, to a tooth assembly for mounting on tooth horns of dragline buckets, backhoe shovels and front-end loader excavation or levelling equipment and engaging the material to be excavated or levelled. In a preferred embodiment, each tooth assembly is characterized by a wedge-shaped adapter which mounts directly on the tooth horn of the bucket, shovel or alternative digging or scraping mechanism of the operation equipment. A wedge-shaped tooth point is transversely seated on and bolted to the extending end of the adapter for engaging the material to be excavated or levelled and a pair of wear caps transversely encapsulate and are bolted to that portion of the adapter which projects between the tooth point and the tooth horn, for extending the life of the tooth assembly during the excavating or levelling operation.\nOne of the problems which is inherent in excavation and levelling operations using heavy equipment such as draglines, backhoes, front-end loaders and similar equipment is that of rapidly wearing the equipment teeth during the excavation or levelling operation. This problem is exacerbated under circumstances where the material to be excavated contains rocks, sand, concrete or other hard or abrasive particles which rapidly wear the bucket or shovel teeth and require expensive periodic retrofits or replacement of the bucket or shovel. Accordingly, it is customary in the industry to provide removable excavating teeth which mount on adapters positioned on shaped, spaced tooth horns provided in the bucket, shovel or other material-moving apparatus, which teeth are typically attached to the tooth adapter using pins or other techniques for removal due to wear. A problem associated with removing these teeth due to periodic wear is the difficulty of driving retaining pins or the like from registering apertures in the teeth and tooth adapters to remove and replace the teeth. Typically, this operation is effected using a large hammer, wherein the pins are manually driven from the teeth and tooth adapter, a procedure which requires considerable effort and is costly due to the labor involved.\nAccordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a tooth assembly for mounting on buckets, shovels or other digging mechanisms in excavating or levelling apparatus, which tooth assembly is characterized by an adapter for removably mounting on each tooth horn of the excavating apparatus bucket, shovel or alternative excavating implement, a tooth point bolted to the tapered front end of the adapter and a pair of wear caps bolted to opposite sides of the adapter between the tooth point and the tooth horn.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a tooth assembly for mounting on each of the teeth of an excavating or levelling apparatus bucket, shovel or alternative digging implement, which tooth assembly includes a wedge-shaped, transversely-slotted adapter for mounting on the tooth horn of the excavating apparatus, a wedge-shaped tooth point fitted with facing tooth point flanges for transversely engaging the corresponding transverse slots located in the adapter and removably fitting the tooth point to the adapter and top and bottom wear caps, each fitted with transverse ribs adapted for engaging corresponding additional grooves or slots provided in the adapter, for transversely mounting the wear caps on opposite sides of the adapter rearwardly of the tooth point to facilitate extended wear of the tooth assembly during excavating or levelling operations.\nA still further object of this invention is to provide a tooth assembly for mounting on the conventional tooth horn of individual teeth in the bucket or shovel of various excavating apparatus, which tooth assembly includes a transversely slotted, wedge-shaped adapter having a lock opening in the top for securing the adapter to the tooth horn, a pair of L-shaped wear caps, each fitted with parallel ribs for engaging the corresponding transversely-oriented slots in the adapter and a pair of bolts for securing the wear caps to the adapter and further including a tooth point, also optionally fitted with a bolt opening and having spaced, facing tooth point flanges for engaging additional corresponding transverse grooves located in the adapter and a bolt or lock plate for securing the tooth point to the adapter forward of the wear caps.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Antinociceptive effects of elevated plus-maze exposure: influence of opiate receptor manipulations.\nIt has been suggested that anxiety may be a critical factor in certain forms of non-opioid environmental analgesia. In the present study, 5-min exposure to the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety (EPM) induced a mild, though enduring, elevation in tail-flick latencies in male mice. Pretreatment with the opiate antagonist naltrexone (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) failed to block EPM-induced antinociception: indeed, the highest dose actually enhanced the response. This effect could not be attributed to intrinsic analgetic activity of naltrexone. Rather, analysis of EPM behaviours suggested that it may have been secondary to an anxiogenic effect of the compound. The involvement of non-opioid substrates in the form of pain inhibition was further supported by the failure of chronic morphine treatment (7 days; 7.5 mg/kg) to alter either the antinociceptive or behavioural response to EPM exposure. Irrespective of treatment history, mice showed a retest EPM profile of enhanced anxiety, with tail-flick data suggesting a major contribution of anticipatory factors. Several important methodological variables are discussed and findings are contrasted with parallel studies on non-opioid defeat analgesia.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Suppression of Rice Blast by Preinoculation with Avirulent Pyricularia oryzae and the Nonrice Pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana.\nABSTRACT Avirulent isolates of Pyricularia oryzae and isolates of Bipolaris sorokiniana, a nonrice pathogen, were used to suppress rice blast caused by P. oryzae. In greenhouse experiments, both fungi substantially reduced leaf blast when applied 24 h or more before the pathogen. B. sorokiniana, but not avirulent isolates of P. oryzae, systemically reduced disease in leaf 5 when applied to whole plants at the four-leaf stage. In field experiments, both fungi were able to reduce neck blast significantly. No increase in grain yield was obtained by using avirulent isolates of P. oryzae, whereas five sprays with B. sorokiniana from seedling to heading stages increased the grain yield in two of three experiments conducted at two locations in Nepal. The significant increase in yield was observed under high inoculum pressure of P. oryzae. Induced resistance is suggested to be involved in the suppression of disease.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

The geometric and electronic structures of these clusters as well as their vibrational frequencies have been characterized. Resonance Raman intensities, associated with the s --> p transition of the unpaired electron, have been estimated for CH(3)OH(2)M(n) (M = CH(3)OH, n = 1-3) clusters. It is shown that with increasing cluster size the simulated spectra converge toward the resonance Raman spectrum of the solvated electron in methanol measured recently by Tauber and Mathies (J. Am.

Our aim was to perform a blinded comparison of the localizing capability of technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT, multiphase multidetector 4D CT, and the combination of these 2 modalities (technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT + multiphase multidetector 4D CT). We reviewed the records of 31 (6 men, 25 women; median age, 56 years) consecutive patients diagnosed with biochemically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism between November 2009 and March 2010 who underwent preoperative technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT and multiphase multidetector 4D CT performed on the same scanner with pathologic confirmation by resection of a single parathyroid adenoma. Accuracy was determined separately for localization to the correct side and quadrant using surgical localization as the standard of reference. Surgical resection identified 14 left and 17 right parathyroid adenomas and 2 left inferior, 12 left superior, 11 right inferior, and 6 right superior parathyroid adenomas. For left/right localization, technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT achieved an accuracy of 93.5% (29 of 31), multiphase multidetector 4D CT achieved 96.8% accuracy (30 of 31), and technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT + multiphase multidetector 4D CT achieved 96.8% accuracy (30 of 31). For quadrant localization, technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT accuracy was 67.7% (21 of 31), multiphase multidetector 4D CT accuracy was 87.1% (27 of 31), and technetium Tc99m sestamibi SPECT + multiphase multidetector 4D CT accuracy was 93.5% (29 of 31).

{"text": "Updated, 3:40 p.m.\n\nAs the White House ramps up its push to woo young voters by urging Congress to head off a scheduled increase in student loan interest rates, GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney struck back Monday, throwing his support behind an extension of the current rates at a campaign event outside Philadelphia.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor made the announcement at a press availability with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, the first joint appearance of Romney and the Florida Republican whose name is often floated as a top choice for his running mate.\n\n“There’s one thing that I wanted to mention, that I forgot to mention at the very beginning, and that was that particularly with the number of college graduates that can’t find work or that can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans,” Romney said at the end of a seven-minute joint news conference with Rubio.\n\n“There was some concern that that would expire halfway through the year, and I support extending the temporary relief on interest rates for students as a result of student loans, obviously, in part because of the extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market.”\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of an Associated Press report showing that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed.\n\nObama devoted his weekly address to the topic of federal student loans, pushing for a renewal by Congress of the 2007 law keeping rates at 3.4 percent. The rates will revert to 6.8 percent in July if Congress does not act. According to the White House, more than 7 million students would be affected by the rate increase.\n\nOn Monday, the White House called Romney’s support of the extension inconsistent with past support for education cuts.\n\n“Mitt Romney continues to make promises that he can’t keep,” said Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. “While he previously endorsed the Ryan budget, which would make deep cuts to Pell Grants and allow student loan rates to double, and last week said that he would gut the Department of Education to pay for his tax plan, today we heard yet another — and contradictory — position from Romney on student loans.”\n\nAlso on Monday, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the education committee, said he plans to introduce a bill later this week that would extend the lower interest rate for one year. He said lawmakers could then consider enacting a more permanent modification when the Higher Education Act comes up for renewal next year.\n\n“Unfortunately, the clock’s ticking,” he said in a conference call with reporters. “We need Republicans in Congress to work with us.”\n\nHarkin said he opposes using other cuts in education to pay for the extension, which is estimated to cost $6 billion, but he had not yet determined how to pay for it. Obama is slated to speak in Harkin’s home state on Wednesday about the rising cost of college education and mounting student debt.\n\nThe office of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) responded to Romney’s move by noting that members of both parties on both sides of the Capitol “will be working on this issue in the coming months.”\n\nBut the top House Republican also framed the expected rise in Stafford loan rates as the result of Democratic policies.\n\n“The rising cost of tuition is a serious problem for students and their families, so it’s unfortunate that Washington Democrats put in place a law that would double student loan rates,” Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.\n\nSen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the No. 3 Senate Democrat and the party’s messaging chief in the upper chamber, said that “what Mitt Romney said — following the president’s lead — is a good thing, but the proof is in the pudding.”\n\n“It’s unclear if it’s simply a way to get on board a popular issue or an effort to actually get something done,” Schumer said. “We’ll see how it plays out over the next few weeks. If Mitt Romney says to the Senate and House Republican leadership, ‘Find a compromise pay-for,’ that would be very helpful.\n\n“But if they’re just going to say we’re for it — but not for paying for it any way that can pass and not for not paying for it — then it’s a game,” he added.\n\nObama’s reelection campaign has been searching for ways to reignite young voters, who provided much of the enthusiasm that helped propel the president to victory four years ago. A poll last week by Georgetown University and the Public Religion Research Institute found that top issues for young voters are jobs and unemployment. Education was nearly tied with the federal deficit for second place.\n\n“We’re not particularly concerned by the president’s appeal to young voters. We think that he has the right vision and the right answers that are gonna appeal to those voters,” Obama’s campaign policy director, James Kvaal, said Monday. “The topic that we’ve been discussing today is a great example of why.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama will travel to Colorado and North Carolina to continue his student-loan push with campaign events at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On Wednesday, he will visit the University of Iowa.\n\nRomney has often made the case along the trail that young people should support his campaign rather than Obama’s because of the country’s economic struggles.\n\nRomney renewed that argument Monday, contending that young voters “are questioning the support they gave to President Obama three-and-a-half years ago.”\n\n“I think young voters in this country have to vote for me if they’re really thinking of what’s in the best interest of the country and what’s in their personal best interest, because the president’s policies have led to extraordinary statistics,” Romney said.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

The Sauvé-Kapandji procedure has been performed to treat rheumatoid or post-traumatic chronic instability and/or arthritis of the distal radioulnar joint. We report a patient with wrist disarticulation that presented to us with limited supination of the wrist due to an injured distal radioulnar joint. We performed the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure, and the patient could regain functional supination of the forearm without losing the ulnar styloid flare that improved prosthetic suspension. This case suggests that the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure can be performed to maintain the advantage of wrist disarticulation even when the initial trauma involves an irreparable injury of the distal radioulnar joint.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\nFrancis M. Jackson and Jackson & MacNichol on brief for appellant.\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, Arthur J. Fried, General Counsel, Charlotte J. Hardnett, Principal Deputy General Counsel, John M. Sacchetti, Associate General Counsel for Litigation, and Etzion Brand, Supervisory Attorney, on brief for appellee.\nBefore Selya, Circuit Judge, Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge, and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\nPer Curiam.\n\n\n1\nClaimant Kevin Weeks applied for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income in March 1998, claiming to have become recently disabled. An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") ruled in his favor. The Appeals Council, acting on its own motion, vacated the recommended decision and remanded for further proceedings. See 20 C.F.R.  404.977(a) (\"The Appeals Council may ... remand a case in which additional evidence is needed or additional action by the [ALJ] is required.\"). The remand order, explaining that the ALJ's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, identified four issues that needed further development and enumerated six specific actions for the ALJ to undertake. Claimant sought judicial review, but the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the remand order was not a \"final decision of the Commissioner\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  405(g). Claimant now challenges this ruling on appeal.\n\n\n2\nClaimant states that there is no case law on point. In fact, various courts have held that an Appeals Council order remanding a case to the ALJ for further proceedings is not an appealable final decision. See, e.g., Culbertson v. Shalala, 30 F.3d 934, 937 n.3 (8th Cir. 1994); Duda v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 834 F.2d 554, 555 (6th Cir. 1987) (per curiam); Dawson v. Sullivan, 136 F.R.D. 621, 623 (S.D. Ohio 1991); accord 4 Social Security Law & Practice  55:28 (Matthew J. Canavan et al. eds., Supp. 1994); cf. Director, O.W.C.P. v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d 11, 12-16 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that order of Benefits Review Board remanding case to ALJ was not appealable \"final order\" under 33 U.S.C.  921(c)).\n\n\n3\nClaimant provides no reason to reach a different result. Contrary to his assertion, the agency regulations draw a clear distinction between a \"decision\" and a \"remand\" in this context. See, e.g., 20 C.F.R.  404.979 (\"the Appeals Council will make a decision or remand the case to an [ALJ]\"); id.  404.901 (defining the two terms separately); accord Carolyn A. Kubitschek, Social Security Disability  6:43, at 401-02 (1994) (\"When the Appeals Council has granted review of a claim, it has several dispositional options. First, it may remand the claim to the ALJ for a new hearing or for further consideration.... The second option of the Appeals Council is to issue a final decision on the claim.\") (footnote omitted).\n\n\n4\nNor does claimant derive any support from Forney v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 266(1998). The issue there--whether a remand order entered by a district court is appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291--implicates entirely separate concerns. Indeed, the Court cited Director, O.W.C.P. and related cases and, rather than casting doubt on their validity, distinguished them on the ground that they \"arose in less closely analogous circumstances.\" 524 U.S. at 272. Forney is thus inapplicable.\n\n\n5\nFor these reasons, which were set forth at greater length by the magistrate judge, we conclude that an order of the Appeals Council vacating an ALJ's recommended decision and remanding for further proceedings is ordinarily not an appealable final decision.1\n\n\n6\nAppeal dismissed.\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n1\n Whether a different result might obtain where the Appeals Council's action is challenged on constitutional or related procedural grounds, see Thomas v. Bowen, 693 F. Supp. 950, 953-54 (W.D. Wash. 1988), or whether such a challenge might give rise to some other form of relief, see Pierce v. Heckler, 620 F. Supp. 320 (D. Ariz. 1985), are matters that need not be determined here. Similarly, we need not decide whether other exceptions may exist (e.g., based on a showing of grave hardship). Cf. Director, O.W.C.P., 853 F.2d at 14.\n\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Why marijuana became illegal is a long story and if you read up on it, you’d see how absurd the whole thing is as well. Now, don’t get us wrong, we’re not here to encourage your kids to start doing drugs but what we are here to do is to change the way you think and feel about cannabis and tell you that if you smoke it the right way, you can also enjoy great health benefits from it asides from the nice high.\n\nRolling up a joint is only one way to take cannabis, the other is to use its extracted essential oil and smoke it in a bubbler, which you can buy online. Smoking in a bubbler eliminates the tar from the smoke, which is the only dangerous part of smoke itself, the rest is all up to what you’re smoking. Here are some of the amazing benefits of smoking cannabis essential oil out of a bubbler.\n\nRelieves Anxiety\n\nOne of the main reasons why people smoke hash and weed is to unwind and that’s exactly why you should do it too. Stress and anxiety takes a huge toll on you and if you take cannabis oil, you can put yourself into a nice light headed and relaxed state that will even help you sleep better at night.\n\nCures Headaches\n\nOne of the best things about cannabis oil is that even in small doses, it can ease what goes on in your head and that includes headaches as well.

{"text": "In the existing technology, when a person passes through a device such as a gate or an entrance guard, an identity authentication needs to be performed on the person. Usually, the authentication is performed only in a single manner, such as fingerprint recognition or face recognition. However, with the development of technology, a single manner of identity authentication is not safe or reliable enough, and the system is vulnerable to an attack, so that the identity of the person to be authenticated cannot be accurately determined or may be misrecognized. On the other hand, a device for identity authentication is greatly affected by external environmental factors. When the resolution is low, the ambient light is poor, or the makeup changes, the identity cannot be accurately recognized, which may cause a deviation in the final authentication result, resulting in misrecognition or inability to recognize, and greatly reducing recognition efficiency and accuracy.\nThe above information disclosed in the background is only for enhancing an understanding of the background of the present disclosure.

{"text": "Amante de lo Ajeno\n\nAmante de lo Ajeno () is the second solo studio album by Mexican singer María José. The name is a play on words, as it is a cover album. It was released on 12 May 2009 on the Sei Track Musica label, a division of Grupo CIE, and reached number 2 in the Mexican album charts.\n\nThe album includes 11 tracks that are part of the Mexican musical memory, previously sung by \"divas\" and pop singers of the '80s. The aim was to pay homage to performers such as Manoella Torres, Daniela Romo, María Conchita Alonso, Lucía Méndez, Ana Gabriel, Jeanette, Vikki Carr, Fiordaliso, Loredana Bertè, Rocío Banquells, Crystal and Melissa. The album was recorded in Riolo Terme, Italy and produced by Loris Cerroni. No Soy Una Señora, originally sung by Melissa, is the first single from the album. José said it brought back memories: \"For 9 years I sang in front of the mirror, I put on my 'Walkman', grabbed my deodorant and sang.\"\n\nThe album has been promoted on Mexican national radio and in TV interviews, and José has performed the single No Soy Una Señora at many events. A year after the original release of the album, Amante de lo Ajeno was re-released as a special edition that included 2 newly recorded covers plus a DVD that featured a concert.\n\nTrack listing\n\nThe album has been certified Gold in Mexico for its 50,000 copies in just 8 weeks on the chart. The album recently has been certified Platinum in Mexico for over 100,000 copies sold in the 30 week on the Mexican Album Chart.

{"text": "Hydroxyurea and sodium phenylbutyrate therapy in thalassemia intermedia.\nHydroxyurea (HU) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with thalassemia intermedia. The reported effects of these agents in increasing total Hb, however, have been inconsistent and there have been no studies on the combination of these medications. We describe the clinical response, as determined by increases in total Hb and decreased transfusion needs, in five patients with thalassemia intermedia treated with HU alone or in combination with SPB. All of the patients responded with increased levels of Hb F, but the responses in total Hb varied. Of the five patients, two had a marked response in total Hb in excess of 3 g/dl, two responded modestly with an increase in total Hb of 1-2 g/dl, and one did not respond. Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb. Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels. Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions. We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions. We, therefore, recommend a trial of HU for thalassemia intermedia patients in whom chronic transfusion therapy is being contemplated.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a hard disk drive, and more particularly, to a write control method of a hard disk drive, a hard disk drive adapting the method, and a recording medium storing a program for executing the method.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nA hard disk drive (HDD) is a magnetic writing device used to store information. Information is written in concentric tracks formed on a surface of a disk. Disks are mounted on a spindle motor to be rotated, and information is accessed by a read/write head mounted on an actuator arm rotated by a voice coil motor (VCM). The VCM is excited by current to rotate an actuator and move heads mounted on an actuator arm across the disk. When the HDD operates, the read/write head should be precisely aligned on tracks of the disk so as to ensure reading and writing information.\nTraditionally, the position of the head is controlled by a servo control circuit. The servo control circuit detects and controls the position of the head using a servo bursts written on the disk.\nIn order to let the head follow the track correctly, servo information including servo bursts should be written on the track. STW (servo track write) is a process for writing such servo information on the disk.\nTo precisely control the position of the head, the quality of the servo bursts written in the STW process, that is, both the intensity and the phase of the servo bursts are important.\nAs a storage density of the HDD increases, a track density increases together. As the track density increases, in contrast, a track width decreases, and, accordingly, the precision necessary to write the servo information on the disk comes up against a limit.\nAs a result, servo bursts written on the disk are hardly uniform by track and even by servo sector in one track.\nThe HDD determines the position of the head using servo bursts. Thus, when the quality of the servo bursts is poor, it becomes difficult to calculate the position of the head correctly, and in worst case particular, the possibility of damaging data on adjacent tracks increases during a write operation.\nFIG. 1 shows the written state of servo bursts according to a 4-servo burst technique. In FIG. 1, “n” denotes a track number, “ID” denotes an inner diameter of the disk, and “OD” denotes an outer diameter of the disk. The 4-servo burst technique uses four kinds of servo bursts, that is, A, B, C, and D servo bursts, and every servo burst is separated from each other by a predetermined distance in a direction of a track and in a direction of the diameter of a disk. Generally speaking, servo bursts are disposed radially on the disk and alternatively in every track or in every half of a track.\nFIG. 2 shows profiles of a servo burst signals read by the head versus an amount of an offtrack. The longitudinal axis represents the position of the head in the diameter direction of the disk, and the perpendicular axis represents the magnitudes (or intensities) of servo bursts read by the head. It can be understood that the position of the head is indicated by a degree (offtrack) as much as deviation of the head from a center of a target track, marked with 0 in the longitudinal axis, as shown in FIG. 1.\nAssuming that servo bursts are written uniformly in sectors and tracks, maximum values of each profile read from servo bursts should be identical, and peaks of servo burst signals read from the A, B, C, and D servo bursts should be disposed in positions off-tracked by −50%, 0%, 50%, or 100%, respectively.\nThe servo control circuit of the HDD calculates the position of the head by comparing magnitudes of four servo burst signals read by the head. Thus, in order to precisely calculate the position of the head, servo bursts should be written uniformly in all sectors and all tracks.\nThe HDD with the 4-servo burst technique generates a position error signal (PES) using Equation 1 as follows.\nIf (−7%<=target offtrack<=7%)PES=PES_(A−B)=A−B\nElse if (−43%<target offtrack<−7%) or (7%<target offtrack<43%)PES=PES—N=(A−B)−(C−D)PES=PES—P=(A−B)+(C−D)\nElse if (−50%<=target offtrack<=43%) or (43%<=target offtrack<=50%)PES=PES_(C−D)=C−D,  (1)\nWhere, the target offtrack indicates an offtrack from a center of the target track to the target position. This notation is useful in the case when there are several data tracks between adjacent servo tracks because the position of the target data track is expressed by an offtrack from the center of target servo track. In addition, the symbols including A, B, C, and D are used to represent servo burst signals or servo bursts, respectively. Values of PESs obtained by a difference (A−B) or (C−D) between two adjacent servo burst signals are referred to as primary PESs, and values of PESs obtained by the sum PES_P and a difference PES_N of the primary PESs are referred to as secondary PESs hereinafter.\nFIG. 3 shows the relationship between the target offtrack and the PES. Referring to FIG. 3, it can be understood that an area A−B uses PES (PES_(A−B)) calculated by A−B (A minus B) within a range of −7 to 7% from a track center, an area C−D uses PES (PES_(C−D)) calculated by C−D within ranges of −43 to −50% and 43 to 50%, and an area NP uses PES (PES_NP) calculated by N (=(A−B)−(C−D)) or P (=(A−B)+(C−D)) within ranges of −43 to −7% or 7 to 43%.\nWith respect to PES_(A−B) or PES_(C−D), the linearity of PES_(A−B) or PES_(C−D) may be distorted due to saturation of (A−B) or (C−D). On the other hand, with respect to PES_NP, saturation of PES_NP does not occur even if saturation of (A−B) or (C−D) occurs. In addition, with respect to PES_NP, discontinuity of PES_NP is generated by offset in the place where PES_N and PES_P are changed, e.g. at the origin in FIG. 3. Thus, the PES should be calculated separately according to areas divided by the magnitude of the target offtrack, as shown in FIG. 3.\nCircles shown in FIG. 3 represent portions where the saturation of (A−B) and (C−D) occurs.\nTo calculate the value of a PES using Equation 1 is based on the assumption that normal servo bursts, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, were written.\nFIG. 4 shows a flowchart of a conventional write control method of the HDD. Referring to FIG. 4, it can be understood that a write operation is started depending on the determination as to whether the value of PES, which is calculated by A−B in the A−B area, exists within a predetermined range, or as to whether the value of PES, which is calculated by C−D in the C−D area, exists within a predetermined range.\nIn operation S402, it is determined whether the target offtrack exists in the area A−B, or exists in an area C−D.\nIf it is determined that the target offtrack exists in the area A−B or the area C−D, based on the determination result in operation S402, a PES is calculated using A−B or C−D in operation S404, respectively. Referring to FIG. 3, a PES is calculated using A−B in the area A−B, and a PES is calculated using C−D in the area C−D.\nIf it is determined that the target offtrack does not exist in the area A−B or C−D in operation S402, a PES is calculated using N or P in operation S406. Referring to FIG. 3, a PES is calculated using N or P in an area NP.\nIn operation S408, it is determined whether the PES calculated in operation S404 or S406 is within a predetermined write bump limit. The calculated PES to be considered in operation S404 is PES_A−B in the area A−B, PES_C−D in the area C−D, or PES_NP in the area NP.\nIf it is determined that the calculated PES is within the predetermined write bump limit in operation S408, the write operation is performed in operation S412, otherwise the write operation is prohibited in operation S410.\nFIG. 5 shows another profile set of servo burst signals read by the head. Referring to FIG. 5, it can be seen that the peak of a servo burst signal is distorted in a portion marked by a circle, and the peaks of the servo burst signals are not precisely disposed in positions off-tracked by −50%, 0%, 50%, or 100%, respectively. Here, the term “distortion” means that a PES does not have linearity.\nFIG. 6 shows the distortion of a PES caused by a defective servo burst as illustrated in FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 6, it can be understood that PES (PES_(A−B)) cannot be linear and is distorted due to a servo burst signal B smaller in magnitude than a servo burst signal A as shown in a portion marked by a circle.\nIf some of servo bursts are defective, as shown in FIG. 5 or if the width of the read head is narrow, distortion may occur in PES (PES_(A−B), PES_(C−D)) calculated by A−B or C−D. Thus, the correct position of the head is not reflected into the PES. In other words, indeed it is determined that a PES is within the write bump limit, but, the head may be not within a range corresponding to the write bump limit. If servo bursts are not written uniformly in all sectors and all tracks, the profile of the servo burst is distorted as shown in FIG. 5, so that the position of the head cannot be calculated correctly.\nIf the position of the head cannot be calculated during a write operation, data may be written in a place away from the center of a data track so that written data cannot be precisely reproduced and data on an adjacent track can be damaged.\nFor this reason, a defect processing process which detects defective servo sectors or tracks and processing them not to be written or read of data is needed in a manufacturing process of an HDD.\nIn the defect processing process, for example, servo bursts are determined as defective when a PES has a value more than a threshold value at the position where data is read or written, and then servo sectors or tracks having those servo bursts are defect-processed.\nHowever, although a PES is satisfactory at the position where the write operation is started, data can be written in incorrect position or data in adjacent tracks may be erased in the case when a defective servo burst exists in some distance from the position.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "The mechanism underlying the high incidence of hypertension (HTN) in obesity and in noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has not been clarified. Our hypothesis is that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance contribute to the pathogenesis of HTN of these states. We suggest that insulin increases blood pressure by enhancing sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow by altering sodium balances via absorptive processes including activation of Na+/K+ ATPase, by modifying the renin-angiotensin system, and by altering vascular responsivity through changes in Mg++ and through mitogenic effects on vessels. In addition, HTN per se causes insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, thus establishing a vicious cycle of events. Nine projects to explore these relationships are planned: 1) In a clinical module, a group of patients will be studied over time who are lean or obese, NIDDM or normal, and hypertensive or normotensive. Glucose and insulin kinetics, SNS, Na+ handling, renin, and various eicosanoids will be measured and correlated. 2) The effect of insulin and the hypertensive state on SNS will be studied both centrally and peripherally in Wistar-Kyoto and SHR rats. 3) The effect of insulin on vascular and cardiac cell growth in culture and on Na+/H+ antiporter and Na/K ATPase activity and gene expression will be quantitated both in vivo and in vitro. 4) The effect of insulin on vascular reactivity and angiotensin II (AII) and norepinephrine action will be studied. 5) We will determine by the role of Magnesium deficiency on vascular reactivity, platelet aggregation, and response to AII. 6) Systemic and renal production of prostacyclin and lipoxygenase (LO) products will be measured in the various clinical groups, during insulin clamp studies, and in a continuum of NIDDM patients with micro and macroalbuminuria. Using renin secreting cells and tissues as a specialized vascular model, the effect of the diabetic state on eicosanoid metabolism, AII action, and role of various growth factors on renin secretion will be explored. 7) Prorenin processing in NIDDM will be determined at the cellular and molecular level. 8) The effects of HTN and insulin on key cardiac protein gene expression and cell mitogenesis will be quantitated. 9) The role of the microcirculation or insulin sensitivity and receptor biology will be researched. The interaction of the various investigators, the presence of the clinical modules and animal core will allow us to extend knowledge and treat this attractive hypothesis in a manner that a series of independent projects could not accomplish.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "OS Museum\n\nThe OS Museum, also known as the OS Ranch Museum, is a hybrid collection of mainly sculpture and paintings of Texas, the American West, and Asia located in the small city of Post, the seat of Garza County in West Texas. It is owned by Giles Connell McCrary, the founder of the OS Ranch Foundation, whose grandfather was an early proprietor of the nearby ranch for which the museum is named. However, the museum exhibits are largely unrelated to the OS Ranch itself. The Spanish conquistador Francisco Coronado passed through this part of Garza County in the 16th century.\n\nKnown for the quality of its exhibits, the museum is located at 201 East Main Street in Post on the second floor in the rear of one of the original buildings constructed there in 1911 by cereal magnate Charles William \"C.W.\" Post, the founder of the community. The building formerly served as the community meeting room. Originally, it had housed the office of the Post Land and Cattle Company. The OS rotates exhibits three times a year.\n\nThough the museum itself is small, the number of exhibits in storage is so large that at least six years usually passes before an artifact is returned to public display. During Easter, for instance, eggs by Faberge, Waterford Crystal, and Lalique are displayed. Christmas exhibits include nativity scenes, creches, ornaments, brass statues, and sculpture. The museum includes the works of many artists of the Southwest who depict Texas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The artifacts exhibited have been collected from throughout the world, including Antarctica, by Giles McCrary and his wife, Helen Louise.\n\nMcCrary was a rancher, businessman, former mayor of Post, and a benefactor of Texas Tech University in nearby Lubbock. McCrary was reared in Fort Worth, where C. W. Post had also resided prior to coming to Post. He attributes his interest in art to his service abroad in World War II, when he was part of the U.S. Army's 63rd Infantry Division. He was in the first unit to cross the Rhine River and penetrate Germany just prior to the surrender in 1945. While abroad, McCrary came upon the European art culture by going to opera houses and listening to concert music.\n\nThe OS Museum is open without charge to the public Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m. except for holidays. Exhibits are changed in February, June, and October, and run for three months. Another interesting stop in Post is the  Garza County Historical Museum.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n OS Ranch - Facebook site\n Attractions in Post, Texas\n\nCategory:History museums in Texas\nCategory:American West museums in Texas\nCategory:Art museums in Texas\nCategory:Asian art museums in the United States\nCategory:Museums in Garza County, Texas", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Google has set its sites on iTunes with the upcoming release of their Google Music Beta. Now Amazon is finally going to take a run at the iPad with their own tablet PC. At least we think they are. While the tablet has never been officially confirmed Amazon’s own CEO Jeff Bezos has said that at some point the internet shopping giant would put out their alternative to the iPad.\n\nNow the Amazon tablet rumors are gaining new steam, thanks to Taiwanese component makers who say they have been told that the parts need to be completed in time for an early fall launch of the tablet. Amazon has always had its fingers on the pulse of the retail business and this situation would be no different as the fall launch would mean that their particular tablet would be out just in time for the holiday shopping season.\n\nAccording to the component makers, Amazon will adopt processors that are designed by Texas Instruments, while the touch panels will be produced by Taiwanese tech company Wintek, ILI Technology is poised to provide the LCD drivers for the devices and Quanta Computers will be tagged to put all the different components together. One bit of extra news is that apparently one of the things that will set this new tablet apart from the others is that Amazon will offer a special streaming service that can be watched on the tablets and only on the tablets (at least for now).\n\nOne final detail from the component makers is that Amazon expects there to be some pretty decent demand for the tablet, with the component makers being asked to ship 700,000-800,000 units per month and targeted sales of four million tablets by the end of the year.\n\nOf course, all of this information is from outside sources and has still not been confirmed by the Amazon bigwigs as of now.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Effects of swimming and environmental hypoxia on coronary blood flow in rainbow trout.\nPrevious studies have suggested that trout cardiac performance is highly dependent on coronary blood flow during periods of increased activity or hypoxia. To examine the relationship between coronary perfusion and cardiac performance in swimming trout, cardiac output (Q), coronary blood flow (qcor), and dorsal aortic blood pressure were measured in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during normoxia and hypoxia (PO2 approximately 9 kPa). In normoxic trout, stepwise changes in cardiovascular variables were observed as the swimming speed was incrementally increased from 0.15 body lengths (bl)/s to 1.0 bl/s. At 1.0 bl/s, qcor and cardiac power output had both increased by approximately 110%, and coronary artery resistance (Rcor) had decreased by 40%. During hypoxia, resting qcor was 35% higher, and Rcor was 20% lower, compared with normoxic values. In hypoxic swimming trout, the maximum changes in qcor (155% increase) and Rcor (50% decrease) were recorded at 0.75 bl/s. In contrast, cardiac power output and Q increased by an additional 40 and 20%, respectively, as swimming speed was increased from 0.75 to 1.0 bl/s. The results indicate that 1) increases in qcor parallel changes in cardiac power output; 2) during hypoxia there are compensatory increases in cardiac performance and coronary perfusion; and 3) the scope for increasing qcor in swimming trout is approximately 150%. In addition, results from preliminary experiments suggest that beta-adrenergic, but not cholinergic, mechanisms are involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow during exercise.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

I had planned to launch my own retail business to cut down commission rates in the industry before I was introduced to Blockchain technology by my friend, Brandon Waiters! We developed the idea together. We pitched our idea to my mentor, François-Henri Pinault of Kering SA. We gathered initial investors like Kering SA and Maserati. Thus, New Royals Gold (NRG) was born!\n\nNRG will enable a platform where luxury products will be sold at 0–1% commission with safe, fast and secure payment cutting bank fees and other fiat inadequacies. NRG is our official token and would carry the same prestige as our brand name therefore it was designed to be in high demand and limited supply.\n\nThe second major challenge is that the luxury industry lacks the level of customization and innovation required to connect with newly affluent individuals. This is a major advantage for the New Royals team made up of creative individuals who are ready to redefine luxury to respond to the millenials mindset.\n\nAt New Royals, we are ready to build wonderful luxury experiences for the newly affluent with captivating innovations and 100% originality. This will attract wealthy investors into the luxury and crypto markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, the luxury market still grew by 5% to an estimated €1.2 trillion globally in 2017. This is an untapped economy by the Blockchain industry. We estimate that the luxury market will grow exponentially when these problems are solved. NRG will be publicly available and traded in exchanges making it possible for everyone to grow with us.\n\nNew Royals is the future of luxury! Do not miss out!

{"text": "Read More About\n\nBurger 21, a new better burger franchise founded by the owners of The Melting Pot Restaurants Inc., announces it has expanded the brand to the northeast with the opening of its first New Jersey location in Voorhees. Currently, Burger 21 has seven restaurants open and 17 franchised locations in development along the East Coast.\n\nLocated in the Voorhees Town Center at 12109 Town Center Blvd., the new restaurant is owned and operated by current The Melting Pot franchisee Charlie Haney, along with business partners Curt Wunder and Mike Astuto. They decided to expand their portfolio based on the extensive training and support Haney received over the years from Front Burner Brands, the concepts’ management company. Haney became a Melting Pot franchisee in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2006 and was named “Melting Pot Franchisee of the Year” in 2010.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Charlie and his team to bring Burger 21 to New Jersey — a hot market right now for better burgers,” says Mark Johnston, Burger 21 president and chief concept officer of Front Burner Brands, management company for Burger 21. “Our crafted burgers, hand-dipped shakes, and menu variety make Burger 21 stand out among better burger concepts, and we have no doubt guests in Voorhees will love what we have to offer.”\n\nHaney, president of ABL Restaurant Management, aims to open a dozen locations throughout southern New Jersey. In addition to offering guests a variety of burgers like the Tex-Mex Haystack, Spicy Thai Shrimp, Black Bean, and Chicken Marsala, the first location in Voorhees also will have craft beer, wines by the glass, and, exclusive to the Voorhees location, adult milk shakes.\n\n“I was blown away by the quality of the food when I visited the first Burger 21 in Tampa, Florida, and could hardly wait for Front Burner Brands to start franchising the concept,” says Haney. “Opening Burger 21 in Voorhees fills the need for gourmet burgers that most people can’t find without going to high-end restaurants with big price tags.”\n\n“We’ve had a strong relationship with Charlie throughout his years as a successful Melting Pot franchisee, and we’re looking forward to expanding that partnership as he and his team grow the Burger 21 brand in New Jersey,” Johnston adds.\n\nTo further fuel Burger 21’s national expansion, the company is actively seeking qualified franchisees and will be exhibiting at the International Franchise Expo June 20-22 at the Javits Center in New York City. Local entrepreneurs are invited to meet with the brand’s franchise development team at booth No. 117 to learn more about growth opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, Burger 21 will host a live webinar on Thursday, May 23, at 2 p.m. EDT.\n\nSince launching its aggressive growth plan in fall 2011, Burger 21 has signed franchise agreements with 10 different entities in seven states to develop a total of 20 franchised units in cities along the East Coast from New York to Florida.\n\nBurger 21 is seeking single- and multi-unit operators with restaurant experience to join its upscale fast casual dining concept. Franchisee candidates should have a minimum net worth of $500,000 and liquid assets of at least $200,000 per unit. Burger 21 will be developed through both single-unit agreements and area development agreements. Depending on the real estate site selected, franchisees can expect the total investment for one restaurant to be approximately $597,995 – $831,995. The initial franchise fee is $40,000; however, reduced franchise fees apply for area development agreements of four or more units.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "FFF Articles\n\nThis two-part essay discusses ten tenets of freedom toward which we must continue to strive in our efforts to restore freedom to our land. Part 1 of the essay discussed the first five tenets and this part covers the other five tenets.\n\n6. Gun control\n\nIt would have been more appropriate to have made the Second Amendment the first amendment to the Constitution. Without the right of the citizenry to keep and bear arms, the fundamental rights enumerated in the First Amendment are worthless. When the citizenry are well-armed, government officials tend to exercise caution in infringing such fundamental rights.\n\nConsider, for example, what took place in Iran after the recent presidential elections there. Iranian citizens were protesting the election results, claiming that the government had rigged the elections. Massive demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of people broke out in protest.\n\nWhat was the response of the government? It decreed the protests to be illegal and announced that anyone who questioned the legitimacy of the elections to be guilty of treason and subject to being executed.\n\nIn other words, the Iranian government did precisely what our American ancestors were certain that the U.S. government would do to them under similar circumstances. That’s why they used the First Amendment to the Constitution to expressly prohibit U.S. officials from doing what Iranian officials have done.\n\nYet while U.S. officials, including those in Congress, will constantly look for ways to suppress criticism of their actions, the likelihood is that they would not go as far as the Iranian officials have gone, at least not without a major crisis to provide them with some cover for doing so.\n\nWhy is that so? Because if U.S. officials ever begin contemplating going down the road that Iranian officials have gone down, they must factor into their deliberations a fact that Iranian officials didn’t have to factor into their deliberations — that the American people, unlike the Iranian people, are well-armed and able to defend themselves against military and police officials who are loyally and patriotically obeying orders to murder peaceful and law-abiding demonstrators, protesters, journalists, bloggers, and other critics of government wrongdoing.\n\nIt is that insurance policy against tyranny that was the primary guiding force behind placing the right to keep and bear arms immediately after the protections regarding freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom to assemble peaceably. The purpose of the Second Amendment is not to guarantee the right of hunting deer or self-protection against criminals. It provides the means by which the citizenry can protect the First Amendment.\n\n7. Civil liberties\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian elections, Iranian officials began rounding up dissidents, incarcerating them, charging them with crimes against the state, and threatening them with kangaroo trials and punishment. That’s the way that tyrannical governments ensure that their orders for people to shut up and stop criticizing government are enforced.\n\nIt is that power — the power to arbitrarily seize people and incarcerate and execute them — that supplies the teeth to the decrees ordering people to shut up. After all, if the government wields the power to tell people to keep silent but lacks the power to do anything to people who refuse to obey the decree, then the first power becomes worthless. The government’s power to arbitrarily arrest, jail, and punish people provides the enforcement mechanism for enforcing its orders for people to cease their criticism of government.\n\nAnd that, in fact, is what the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution are all about. Our American ancestors were certain that once they called the federal government into existence, federal officials would end up doing the same types of things that the Iranian government officials are doing to the Iranian people. After all, why have express restrictions on the abuse of power if the threat of such abuse is nonexistent or remote?\n\nThus, Americans are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures because our American ancestors believed that that’s what federal officials would subject them to. The same holds true for the freedom not to be coerced or tortured into making confessions. They knew that federal officials would do such a thing, which is why they expressly prohibited them from doing it. The right to effective assistance of counsel was intended to prevent federal officials from railroading and steamrolling people into jail and concentration camps.\n\nThe right of trial by jury was intended to protect Americans from the kangaroo tribunals employed in places like Iran. Juries, not judges or other government officials, would be the final arbiters of the law and the guilt or innocence of the accused. Cruel and unusual punishments, such as torture and sex abuse, were expressly prohibited because of the belief that government officials would inevitably employ such tactics.\n\nThe ancient writ of habeas corpus was expressly protected in the original Constitution. The Framers understood that it is the linchpin of a free society. For if people have no means by which to challenge in an independent judicial forum their arbitrary detention by government officials, then civil liberties become a dead letter.\n\nUnfortunately, all too many modern-day Americans have been taught to believe that civil liberties are nothing more than the means by which guilty people get to escape punishment for crimes they have committed. Nothing could be further from the truth. As our Americans ancestors understood so well, civil liberties protect the citizenry from arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, and punishment at the hands of government officials who are doing their best to quell dissent and criticism of wrongful government conduct.\n\n8. The drug war\n\nThe drug war perfectly encapsulates the loss of freedom that the American people have suffered under the paternalistic regulatory state. What could be a more perfect assault on the freedom of the individual than for the state to have the power to arrest someone and punish him for doing nothing more than selling, purchasing, possessing, or ingesting some substance that government officials don’t approve of?\n\nEveryone would agree that some substances can be harmful if ingested, especially in excess. Alcohol, tobacco, sugar, and fatty foods are examples. That’s not the point. The point is whether freedom entails the right to ingest whatever a person wishes to ingest and, if so, whether the state should be permitted to infringe that important aspect of freedom.\n\nImagine a person sitting within the privacy of his own home. He’s drinking booze, smoking cigarettes, ingesting marijuana, snorting cocaine, swallowing prescription drugs, and injecting heroin. We can all agree that such conduct is unwise and detrimental to good health. But under what moral authority does a government official punish another adult for doing bad things to himself? How can such power possibly be reconciled with basic principles of individual liberty?\n\nNot only has the war on drugs constituted one of most direct assaults on individual liberty in U.S. history, it has also spawned an enormous array of other infringements on liberty. It is impossible to measure, for example, the extent to which the American people are subjected to searches and seizures at the hands of government officials because of the war on drugs.\n\nThere are also the tremendous assaults on financial privacy that the drug war has generated. Asset-forfeiture laws have provided a means by which public officials have become financially dependent on the drug war, not to mention the direct stealing of money from citizens that voracious cops commit under the guise of asset-forfeiture laws. Bribery, payoffs, and other forms of corruption have spread through the ranks of law enforcement and the judiciary, thanks to the drug war.\n\nAfter more than three decades of drug warfare and the ruination of countless people with drug problems, what do drug-war proponents have to show for their efforts? Nothing, except death, destruction, corruption, violence, and the ruination of countless lives. Nonetheless, the war just keeps going on and on and on, with no end in sight. All that matters is that more arrests and punishments continue taking place and that more money keeps flowing into the hands of the people who are benefiting from the war, including government officials.\n\nThere is one — and only one — solution to this craziness: the legalization of drugs. The restoration of liberty in America necessitates an immediate end to drug-war prohibition.\n\n9. The monetary system\n\nThe United States was founded on a monetary system based on gold coins and silver coins. The reason for that was that the Framers understood that one of the greatest threats to the freedom and well-being of the citizenry was the government’s propensity to plunder and loot people’s wealth through the excess printing of paper money. Thus, by rejecting paper money in favor of gold coins and silver coins, our ancestors removed one of the most popular means that government officials have used to inflate the currency.\n\nThat intent was manifested in the Constitution. For example, the powers delegated to Congress did not include the power to issue paper money, establish a central bank, or enact legal-tender laws. There were also express provisions prohibiting the states from making anything but gold and silver coins legal tender and from issuing “bills of credit,” i.e., paper money.\n\nThe result was the soundest monetary system in history. People didn’t need to worry about losing their wealth through inflation. Throughout the 19th century, companies were issuing 100-year bonds payable in gold coins, and the result was massive amounts of capital flowing into the United States and being retained in the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, modern-day Americans decided to abandon that monetary system in favor of the one that has characterized other nations in history, one based on paper money, a central bank (i.e., the Federal Reserve System), and legal-tender laws. This monetary system has provided the federal government with the means to plunder and loot people indirectly and surreptitiously through the process of inflation.\n\nThe beauty of the system, from the standpoint of public officials, is that very few citizens are able to figure out what is going on. They see prices of nearly everything rising but they’re unable to recognize that what’s actually happening is that it’s the value of their currency that is dropping, owing to the massive amounts of new money that the government is injecting into the system. Thus, many people inevitably fall into the trap of blaming businessmen, oil companies, grocery stores, gasoline stations, speculators, and entrepreneurs for rising prices, rather than laying blame where it properly lies — with the government that is artificially expanding money and credit.\n\nA society in which government wields the power to inflate the currency to finance its ever-increasing projects and programs cannot be considered a free society. How can people truly be free when the government wields the monetary power to take away everything they own?\n\nThe monetary standard of gold coins and silver coins served as an adequate protection for more than 100 years of American history. Nonetheless, it was not the ideal. The ideal is a free-market monetary system, one in which the market — i.e., consumers and producers — have the freedom to determine the medium of exchange that they themselves decide to use. That is what the Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek referred to as the “denationalization of money.” While the free market would very likely rely on metals-based coins, there is always the possibility that the miracle of the market could come up with media of exchange that people have never dreamed of.\n\nWhat would a free-market monetary system entail? The repeal of all legal-tender laws, the dismantling of the Federal Reserve System, and, best of all, a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a permanent separation of money and the state.\n\n10. Militarism and empire\n\nWhen the United States was founded, the world was shocked by an unusual feature of American life: No standing military force, no conscription, no alliances with other nations, and a steadfast refusal to get involved in foreign conflicts.\n\nThe fact is that Americans had had a bellyful of empire, militarism, and foreign wars, which is what the British Empire was all about. They were also sick and tired of the debts, taxes, bureaucracy, regulations, gun control, and infringements on privacy and civil liberties that come with empire.\n\nTheir idea was obviously a radical one: The new government would lack the military means and power to go abroad and save people from tyranny, oppression, starvation, or anything else. If people wished to escape such conditions, however, they would know that there was at least one nation in the world to which they could go, a nation whose borders were open and whose government would not forcibly repatriate people to their country of origin.\n\nOur American ancestors didn’t like militarism. And they understood one of the most important lessons in history regarding standing armies: that regimes inevitably use such armies to suppress the rights and liberties of their own citizenries, as the citizens of Iran, China, Burma, North Korea, Cuba, and so many others will attest.\n\nThus, our ancestors decided that America would be a limited-government, constitutional republic, one without an enormous standing army.\n\nSo how did they intend to protect the United States? Well, for one thing they understood that few countries had the military means by which to send enormous armies across the ocean to successfully invade and occupy the United States.\n\nMore important, they placed their faith in a free people, who could be counted on to keep themselves armed and trained to fight and shoot, and who would be readily available as citizen soldiers to quickly rally to the cause of repelling a foreign invader. They understood that to attack a free nation whose citizenry will fight to remain free and who are armed and trained would be akin to swallowing a porcupine.\n\nUnfortunately, and oddly, modern-day Americans have abandoned their founding principle of a limited-government republic and endorsed the very concept of empire against which the Founding Fathers rebelled. Today, America is characterized by an enormous standing army whose tentacles reach not only into cities and towns across America but also all over the world.\n\nThrough the CIA and the Pentagon, the U.S. empire engages in all the things that our American ancestors found abhorrent: foreign interventions, foreign wars, entangling alliances, foreign aid, foreign meddling, assassinations, coups, torture, invasions, wars of aggression, and brutal occupations. It’s all done, of course, in the name of “freedom,” the bogus buzz word that has guided empires throughout history.\n\nMoreover, with its domestic empire of military bases, the Pentagon has millions of Americans dependent on military largess. Towns and cities across the land live in perpetual fear that the Pentagon might target them for base closure.\n\nWith empire have come ever-increasing debts and taxes, bureaucracy, regimentation, the ever-present threat of terrorist retaliation, assaults on privacy and civil liberties, kidnapping and rendition, indefinite detention, death and destruction, torture and sex abuse, and monetary debauchery.\n\nBy their fruits you will know them!\n\nThe solution is simple: abandon all the foreign military bases, bring all the troops home, discharge them, close the bases here at home, discharge those troops, and rely on well-trained, well-armed citizen soldiers in the highly unlikely event that the United States is ever invaded by some foolish foreign regime.\n\nIn fact, the solution to all of America’s woes is simple, for all it entails is restoring the principles of liberty on which our nation was founded and then building on them to take America to even greater heights as a model society of freedom.

With the great success we are having actually of indie developers registering, we are seeing incredible numbers of new companies coming to the platform. There is a real sense that PS4 – and Vita as well, PS3 still has a long life – that this is a great opportunity for them to come back to console.”\n\nHe added: “We are really accelerating and changing the way we approach this. So before was more of a narrow cast, now there is a real opportunity for us to go what I call broadcast – a lot more visibility to be able to answer the questions.\"\n\nSimonetta also said that the current number of indies registering to develop for the PS4, as well as Vita and PS3, was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\nAlthough he wouldn’t go into specific numbers, he said: \"I can tell you I have been there for four years, and one of my colleagues has been in third-party relations for ten years, and we’ve never seen anything like this.

(Reuters)\n\nLiberians began three days of fasting and prayers on Wednesday to seek salvation from the \"curse\" of the Ebola epidemic, which has killed 2,705 people and infected 4,665 more in the West African country.The National Christian Ebola Task Force, an organisation formed in September by different Christian denominations, urged Liberians to fast from dawn-to-dusk over the next three days.\"Ebola is a virus from the devil. It's killing us because we have turned our back to God,\" Reverend David G. Benitoe, a representative of the task force, told a news conference.\"We have traded the worship of God with the worship of demons and witchcraft, and evil stuff is now happening in this country,\" Benitoe said.Liberia is the country hardest-hit by the worst outbreak on record of the viral haemorrhagic fever, which is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of those infected.In total, the epidemic has killed nearly 5,000 people and infected some 13,703 people since it was first reported in Guinea in March.The disease has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Nigeria, with Mali becoming this month the sixth West Africa nation touched by the outbreak. Nigeria and Sierra Leone have now been declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization.Isolated cases have also been reported in Spain and the United States.This month, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Reuters her government had detected the first signs of an easing in the epidemic as public awareness of the disease improved.The WHO also said on Wednesday there were indications it was slowing, with falls in the number of burials, new admissions and a plateau in laboratory-confirmed cases.About 85 per cent of Liberia's 4 million people are Christians, while about 12 per cent are Muslims. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Liberians have packed churches on Sunday, singing and praying for deliverance.Thousands of mobile phone subscribers received text messages on their phones on Wednesday asking them to take part.\"I have the faith that after Friday things will not be the same in Liberia with Ebola,\" said Mary Freeman, who attends the Faith Healing Temple of Jesus Christ of Monrovia, adding that she had started fasting on Wednesday morning.\"The Lord has taken pre-eminence over our situation.\"\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2014\n\nBenitoe said the fast and prayer will be concluded on Friday with prayers and communion services across the country, but because Ebola is highly infectious, people would have to avoid touching one another during the communion.\"No one is going to be serving the communion. You will have you buy your own communion elements. Bread and wine or biscuit and non-alcoholic wine or red juice,\" he said.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Assessing the quality of care for paediatric depression and anxiety in Australia: A population-based sample survey.\nWe examine the prevalence of quality care (as measured by adherence to recommendations in clinical practice guidelines) for Australian paediatric patients (⩽15 years) with depression and/or anxiety, using data from the CareTrack Kids study; a population-based study of the quality of healthcare practice in inpatient and ambulatory healthcare settings. A multistage stratified sample identified records of 6689 children. Of these, 156 records were identified for depression and 356 for anxiety. These were assessed for adherence to 15 depression and 13 anxiety indicators, respectively, using a review of medical records. Adherence to assessment and management guidelines was low for both conditions: assessment bundle (depression = 33%, 95% confidence interval = [20, 48]; anxiety = 54%, 95% confidence interval = [43, 64] and depression management bundle = 35%, 95% confidence interval = [15, 60]). Across both conditions, the highest adherence was recorded for indicators that addressed prescription of medications (e.g. venlafaxine, 100%; benzodiazepines, 100%; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 94% and antidepressants, 91%), while compliance was the lowest for ensuring children with depression had an emergency safety plan (44%), informing parents of the risks and benefits of prescribed anxiety medication (51%) and assessment for other causes (59% for depression; 68% for anxiety). These findings suggest that strategies are needed to improve guideline adherence for mental health disorders in children and adolescents, particularly among general practitioners.

{"text": "The ultimate objective for this program is to develop a hybrid active and passive magnetic bearing based, rotodynamic, continuous flow implantable ventricular assist device. Development and integration of the MiTi hybrid active/passive magnetic bearing with a motor driven Impeller will result in a compact, low power consumption, highly reliable continuous flow blood pump. Key elements of the proposed program include 1) a detailed integrated blood pump and hybrid bearing design; 2) component bearing testing to validate the bearing design; 3) fabrication of up to three prototype pumps; 4) in-vitro testing of the fabricated pump; and 5) preliminary in-vivo studies. In-vitro testing will validate pump and bearing performance, verify that washing flows limit deposition, and verify the lack of hemolysis damage to blood circulated through the pump. In-vivo testing is planned to demonstrate freedom from deposition-related difficulties with the rotodynamic pump. Key features of the blood pump include only one actively controlled magnetic bearing axis for reliability and simplicity; elimination of conventional displacement sensors through the use of self sensing technology to further enhance reliability; large clearance passages surrounding the pump motor and bearing yielding low blood shear stresses (well below the hemolysis damage threshold) and promoting good forward washing flows.

{"text": "---\nabstract: |\n    Sparse superposition codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes for efficient communication over the AWGN channel at rates approaching the channel capacity. In a standard SPARC, codewords are sparse linear combinations of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix, while in a spatially coupled SPARC the design matrix has a block-wise structure, where the variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied across blocks. A well-designed spatial coupling structure can significantly enhance the error performance of iterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP).\n\n    In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic bound on the probability of error of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying this bound to a simple band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights how the decay of error probability depends on each design parameter of the spatially coupled SPARC.\n\n    The asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) of the AMP decoder can be predicted via a deterministic recursion called state evolution. Our result provides the first proof that the MSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction for spatially coupled designs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this result implies that spatially coupled SPARCs with the proposed band-diagonal design are capacity-achieving. The proof technique used to establish the main result is also used to obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to compressed sensing with spatially coupled design matrices. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results that demonstrate the finite length error performance of spatially coupled SPARCs. The performance is compared with coded modulation schemes that use LDPC codes from the DVB-S2 standard.\nauthor:\n- 'Cynthia Rush[^1]'\n- 'Kuan Hsieh[^2]'\n- 'Ramji Venkataramanan[^3]'\ntitle: ' Capacity-achieving Spatially Coupled Sparse Superposition Codes with AMP Decoding '\n---\n\n[^1]: Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

{"text": "When it comes down to it, game 2.0 proponents don’t truly understand game. They may think they do, but they don’t. What they’re dealing with is a “watered down” version of game:\n\n“that is NOT game 101. that is WATERED DOWN game 101.”\n\nYes. Exactly.\n\nSusan’s biggest problem is that she *thinks* she understands game, and men.\n\nWell, it’s not what we know in life that gets us into trouble; it’s what we think we know that just ain’t so.\n\nSusan is, and will always be, part of Team Woman.\n\nWhat does “watered down game” attempt to produce? Some would call it a “better beta”, but it would be accurate to say a “better” chump. The biggest threat to form of promiscuity women prefer is men who were supposed to be the chumps that they married realizing the truth and avoiding becoming a chump. Whether these men decided to become a PUA or a ghost or something in between doesn’t matter. With knowledge these men can choose a path other than being a chump. The weakest link (to women) in the female preferred form of promiscuity is finding a chump when a woman is done with the alpha carousel because either the chumps will discover the truth and not be chumps or the chumps won’t be attractive to women. Game 2.0 tries to attack that problem by watering down game so only the desired result of a “better” chump can be produced. This will never work since game 2.0 proponents don’t truly understand game in the first place.\n\nAs someone who actually studied Game for several years it’s coming to the point where I really have no idea what it means anymore.\n\nThe Frost/Elam debate informed us that Game was the study of how women react to men’s behavior. And successful game is whatever results in your p in her v.\n\nTherefore, if Walsh’s tactics result in p in v, why are we knocking it? When DeAngelo and Neil Strauss praise feminism and hand out pussy passes for shit tests because “women can’t help it” apparently that is also valid Game because they get p in v. A lot of PUAs are anti- men’s rights. But they get p in v so that must make it ok. Dozens of PUAs essentially train men to become calliope monkeys for female amusement. But they get p in v so that makes it ok?\n\nAt one point I felt that Game could be an emancipatory technology for men. But that was because I thought that Game only included strategies by which a man could truly take his power back.\n\nAs I now understand it, I have to say that Game in all it’s iterations is actually detrimental to men, because simply getting p in v does not emancipate men from the matriarchy. In fact, it further entrenches.\n\nSo I’m hard-pressed to see why we are shaking fingers at Walsh when we probably should be cleaning our own house first.\n\nTherefore, if Walsh’s tactics result in p in v, why are we knocking it? When DeAngelo and Neil Strauss praise feminism and hand out pussy passes for shit tests because “women can’t help it” apparently that is also valid Game because they get p in v.\n\nIn Susan Walsh’s case they don’t work because she has no clue on how to deal with heterosexual women as a man wanting to have sex and/or have a relationship with them. The problem with her and others like OneSTDV is that they’re not actually using game. They’re just blabbering on about it for anti-male reasons.\n\nDeAngelo and Strauss tactics work I would assume since they would have to generate results, but every man has to ask himself if it’s worth it. For many men it’s not and they decide to go ghost or some of non-game option which is perfectly valid.\n\nSusan Walsh hates the hookup culture in college and began her blog primarily to warn young college women against it, when she herself had a daughter in college a few years ago – she’s just graduated.\n\nShe basically hates alpha male priorities having dominance in the college age and middle twenties American culture. To her credit she has figured out that the primary reason why is “sex positive” slut sheltering American feminism is the main reason why, but she just instinctually wants to blame and shame male players too, most recently me (though it didn’t go so well her way, beta males and other alpha’s there weren’t much in support, to her dismay, only a few. She has had no real logical answer to my retorts, but she kept plugging away at me, and rallying the few female commenters there (as opposed to lurkers) to largely agree with her. Still, made no real headway against me. Heh. Female jealously not only as an innate instinct but also as sort of a divine right to be respected, was the common theme, against all logic and international example of how that varies a lot culturally in it’s intensity and low or high trigger of abandonment threat.\n\nGame 3.0 is recognizing that there is a yin-yang effect. On one hand you’ve got all the stuff that gets your foot in the door, basically all the outer-game elements and perhaps an opener and routine or three. On the other hand is all the stuff that keeps her interest long-term. This is where the holistic self-improvement pays off and building true confidence and developing inner-game really matters.\n\nHasn’t Game always fundamentally been sanitized and presented as woman-friendly and pro-feminist? The public faces of Game well-known to the public aren’t Roosh or Roissy; it’s Mystery and Neil Strauss. Have they ever said as much as one bad word about feminism? No.\n\n“That said, Roissy and Roosh are better teachers of Game that those who peddle seminars.”\n\nRoissy & Roosh teach watered down game, their advice is not real PUA, Roosh is a ridiculously poor PUA compared to a real pua, he’s a joke, his success rate is that of a beginner pua & he’s far too empathetic towards the women he beds, typical of a rookie pua\n\nRoosh is a beginner number batter, he plays the numbers, he doesnt peacock, or uses alot of PUA concepts & very rarely teaches a clear method of pua, most of his advice is opinion equivelant of a beginner pua\n\nRoosh’s trips to other countries are merely hype with no substance\n\nIn short Roissy & Roosh simply cant afford to teach real pua, as they’ll alienate most of the men reading their blogs\n\nReal pua is pretty hardcore & requires a major re-evaluation of a persons personality, if they pointed out the vast majority of their readers were STILL NOWHERE near being a pua, after spending years reading their posts, you’d get some pretty pissed off blog readers\n\nMystery & Strauss will always pay lipservice to feminism in their interviews, it brings in the big bucks.\n\nOutside of the media interviews theres virtually no feminism …\n\nYes Mysteries said crap like leaving her better then you found her …. but thats relative to how much you neg & game the girl … nothing to do with feminism\n\nI always find it hilarious how far the mangina anti-gamers like novy go to try & persuade ppl game is some sort of scam …\n\nThe REAL PUA’s & Gamers are out there, ppl like David Deida, Vin DeCarlo, Krauser etc., just dont expect the likes of Alek Novy to point them out, as anti-gamers like him its all about selling mis-information to gullible manginas\n\nI’ve been in the PUA community for over 5 years now, & I dont consider Roissy or Roosh as real PUA’s, alot of their advice is watered down game, compared to heavy weight PUA’s like David Deida, Vin DeCarlo etc.\n\nReal game is pretty ruthless when it comes to women & the inner game concepts, if Roosh or Roissy tried teaching the more hardcore concepts of PUA, or Real Inner Game theory, theyd alienate alot of men\n\nReal effective game requires ruthless confidence bordering on narcisstic, as thats what it takes to game a HB10\n\nReal game is Essentially State Game, Frame Control, Insane levels of confidence & most importantly the ability to induce your willpower over another person\n\nNever admit your wrong, treat every mistake as a solution, never apologise for your needs as a man ….\n\nrmaxd, there doesn’t seem to be many reasonably priced and useful NLP stuff in video format. There is much more stuff in book form. It seems some books target business audience but I didn’t see much wrt hooking up although one can imagine and test one’s idea.\n\n1) A natural who was doing some things right, and can now supercharge his results with new added information.\n\n2) A man who was good on paper, but underperforming due to anti-Game, or pedestalization.\n\nCompletely agree, those are the best candidates. I’ve said that myself many times. I myself who am more or less a natural (taught myself game from observation and close analysis long before the word was invented, from some combination of 1 & 2 beginnings, thus erasing most of my anti-game.) Though reading Mystery and esp. Roissy did have the ! result, though I was doing most but not all things right. I mean since early middle school or maybe forever I’ve been in favor of male psychosexual dominance and NEVER bought the feminist doctrine to the contrary. That said, how to pull that off early one, what with all my nice guy early programming, took effort and determination.\n\nI do think that center betas who aren’t real leaders of men, can move up to greater beta abilities with girls if they really grok an practice game. Probably not higher barring special circumstances. I mean if you’re really not good with people of either sex, except in a following way, dunno. Seems unlikely to me.\n\nHaha, initially, I always read ‘OneSTDV’ as ‘OneSTD’ and wondered why one would to admit to his one sexual transmitted disease on one’s blog. Later, it appears he wants to say that some of his traits is equal to some population mean +/- 1 standard deviation. Didn’t he do any testing that he gives him an point estimate rather than some confidence interval Either way, it is not very impressive. Does he refer to height, iq or something?\n\nThanks pal. I haven’t been in this “game 2.0” debate but I’ll tell you Roissy had a huge influence on me 2 years ago (to the point where I read his whole archives in a few weeks) and I still read him weekly. I consider him at (or at least near) the cutting edge of game theory through his focus on alpha and societal context of male/female relationships.\n\nThat said, no-one has ever written a game resource that trumps the mass-market Mystery Method book.

{"text": "THE BOOK OF PLEASURE (SELF-LOVE).\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF ECSTASY.\nBY AUSTIN OSMAN SPARE.\nDEFINITIONS.\nThe words God, religions, faith, morals, woman, etc. (they being forms\nof belief), are used as expressing different \"means\" as controlling\nand expressing desire: an idea of unity by fear in some form or\nanother which must spell bondage-the imagined limits; extended by\nscience which adds a dearly paid inch to our height: no more.\nKia: The absolute freedom which being free is mighty enough to be\n\"reality\" and free at any time: therefore is not potential or manifest\n(except as it's instant possibility) by ideas of freedom or \"means,\"\nbut by the Ego being free to recieve it, by being free of ideas about\nit and by not believing. The less said of it (Kia) the less obscure is\nit. Remember evolution teaches by terrible punishments-that conception\nis ultimate reality but not ultimate freedom from evolution.\nVirtue: Pure Art\nVice: Fear, belief, faith, control, science, and the like.\nSelf-Love: A mental state, mood or condition caused by the emotion of\nlaughter becoming the principle that allows the Ego appreciation or\nuniversal association in permitting inclusion before conception.\nExhaustion: That state of vacuity brought by exhausting a desire by\nsome means of dissipation when the mood corresponds to the nature of\nthe desire, i.e., when the mind is worried because of the\nnon-fulfilment of such desire and seeks relief. By seizing this mood\nand living, the resultant vacuity is sensitive to the subtle\nsuggestion of the Sigil.\nDIFFERENT RELIGIONS AND DOCTRINES AS MEANS TO PLEASURE, FREEDOM AND POWER.\nWhat is there to believe, but in Self? And Self is the negation of\ncompleteness as reality. No man has seen self at any time. We are what\nwe believe and what it implies by a process of time in the conception;\ncreation is caused by this bondage to formula.\nActions are the expressions of ideas bound up in the belief; they\nbeing inherent are obscure, their operation indirect, easily they\ndeceive introspection. Fruits of action are two-fold, Heaven or Hell,\ntheir Unity or Nothingness (Purgatory or Indifference). In Heaven\nthere is desire for Women. Hell the desire intense. Purgatory is\nexpectation delayed. Indifference but disappointment till\nrecovery. Then verily they are one and the same. The wise pleasure\nseeker, having realised they are \"different degrees of desire\" and\nnever desirable, gives up both Virtue and Vice and becomes a\nKiaist. Riding the Shark of his desire he crosses the ocean of the\ndual principle and engages himself in self-love.\nReligions are the projection of incapacity, the imaginations of fear,\nthe veneer of superstition, that paradox is truth, * while ofttimes\nthe ornamentation of imbecility. As a virtue in the Idea to maximize\npleasure cheaply, remit your sins and excuse them-is but ceremonial,\nthe expression of puppetry to the governing fear. Yes! What you have\nordained in your religiousness, is your very rack, imagined though it\nbe! The prospect is not pleasant; you have taught yourself! It has\nbecome inborn and your body is sensitive.\n* That God is always in Heaven or that the Almighty inconceivable\nemanates its conception or negation-commits suicide, etc.\nSome praise the idea of Faith. To believe that they are Gods (or\nanything else) would make them such-proving by all they do, to be full\nof its non-belief. Better is it to admit incapacity or insignificance,\nthan reinforce it by faith; since the superficial \"protects\" but does\nnot change the vital. Therefore reject the former for the\nlatter. Their formula is deception and they are deceived, the negation\nof their purpose. Faith is denial, or the metaphor Idiotcy, hence it\nalways fails. To make their bondage more secure Governments force\nreligion down the throats of their slaves, and it always suceeds;\nthose who escape it are but few, therefore their honour is the\ngreater. When faith perishes, the \"Self\" shall come into its\nown. Others less foolish, obscure the memory that God is a conception\nof themselves, and as much subject to law. Then, this ambition of\nfaith, is it so very desirable? Myself, I have not yet seen a man who\nis not God already.\nOthers again, and those who have much knowledge, cannot tell you\nexactly what \"belief\" is, or how to believe in what defies natural\nlaws and existing belief. Surely it is not by saying \"I believe\"; that\nart has long been lost. They are even more subject to bewilderment and\ndistraction directly they open their mouths full of argument; without\npower and unhappy unless spreading their own confusion, to gain\ncogency they must adopt dogma and mannerism that excludes possibility\n. . . . . . By the illumination of their knowledge they\ndeteriorate in accomplishment. Have we not watched them decay in\nration to their expoundings? Verily, man cannot believe by faith or\ngain, neither can he explain his knowledge unless born of a new\nlaw. We being everything, wherefore the necessity of imagining we are\nnot?\nBe ye mystic.\nOthers believe in prayer . . . . have not all yet learnt, that to\nask it to be denied? Let it be the root of your Gospel. Oh, ye who are\nliving other peoples lives! Unless desire is subconscious, it is not\nfulfilled, no, not in this life. Then verily sleep is better than\nprayer. Quiescence is hidden desire, a form of \"not asking\"; by it the\nfemale obtains much from man. Utilize prayer (if you must pray) as a\nmeans of exhaustion, and by that you will obtain your desire.\nSome do much to show the similarity of different religions; certainly\nby it I prove the possibility of a fundamental illusion, but that they\nnever realise-or this Ukase they are the mockery, for how much they\nregret! They suffer more conflict than the unenlightened. With what\nthey can identify their own delusion of fear they call truth. They\nnever see this similarity and the quintessence of religions, their own\npoverty of imagination and religion's palliation. Better is it to show\nthe essential difference of religions. It is as well to know that\nvarious means; is not their object to deceive and govern? Surely then,\nfor the attainment of the transcendental, God and religion should have\nno place.\nSome praise truth so-called, but give it many containers; forgetting\nits dependence they prove its relationship and paradox, the song of\nexperience and illusion. Paradox is not \"truth\", but the truth that\nanything can be true for a time. What supersedes paradox and its\nimplicit (\"not necessary\"), I will make the foundation of my\nteaching. Let us determine the deliberative, \"the truth\" cannot be\ndivided. Self-love only cannot be denied and is Self-love as such when\nparadoxical, under any condition, hence it alone is truth, without\naccessories complete.\nOthers praise ceremonial Magic, and are supposed to suffer much\nEcstasy! Our asylums are crowded, the stage is over-run! Is it by\nsymbolizing we become the symbolized? Were I to crown myself King,\nshould I be King? Rather should I be an object of disgust or\npity. These Magicians, whose insincerity is their safety, are but the\nunemployed dandies of the Brothels. Magic is but one's natural ability\nto attract without asking; ceremony what is unaffected, its doctrine\nthe negation of theirs. I know them well and their creed of learning\nthat teaches the fear of their own light. Vampires, they are as the\nvery lice in attraction. Their practices prove their incapacity, they\nhave no magic to intensify the normal, the joy of a child or healthy\nperson, none to evoke their pleasure or wisdom from themselves. Their\nmethods depending on a morass of the imagination and a chaos of\nconditions, their knowledge obtained with less decency than the hyena\nhis food, I say they are less free and do not obtain the satisfaction\nof the meanest among animals. Self condemned in their disgusting\nfatness, their emptiness of power, without even the magic of personal\ncharm or beauty, they are offensive in their bad taste and mongering\nfor advertisement. The freedom of energy is not obtained by its\nbondage, great power not by disintegration. Is it not because our\nenergy (or mind stuff) is already over bound and divided, that we are\nnot capable, let alone magical?\nSome believe any and every thing is symbolic, and can be transcribed,\nand explain the occult, but of what they do not know. (Great spiritual\ntruths?) So argument a metaphor, cautiously confusing the obvious\nwhich developes the hidden virtue. This unnecessary corpulency,\nhowever impressive, is it not disgusting? (The Elephant is exceeding\nlarge but extremely powerful, the swine though odious does not breed\nthe contempt of our good taste.) If a man is no hero to his servant,\nmuch less can he remain a mystic in the eyes of the curious;\nsimilarity educates mimicry. Decorate your meaning, however\nobjectionable (as fact), after you have shown your honesty. Truth,\nthough simple, never needs the argument of confusion for obscurity;\nits own pure symbolism embraces all possibilities as mystic\ndesign. Take your stand in commonsense and you include the truth which\ncannot lie; no argument has yet prevailed. Perfect proportion suggest\nno alteration, and what is useless decays.\nThey reject all the modern symbolism*(1) and reach an absurd limit\nvery early. Not counting on change*(2) and (at times) the arbitrary\nnature of symbolism or the chance of a preserved folly, by their\nadoption of the traditional without a Science, as having reading to\nthe present, their symbolism is chaotic and meaningless. Not knowing\nthe early rendering, they succeed in projecting their own meagreness\nby this confusion, as explaining the ancient symbols. Children are\nmore wise. This conglomeration of antiquity decayed, collected with\nthe disease of greed-is surely the chance for charity? Forgetting\ntrumpery ideas, learn the best tradition by seeing you own functions\nand the modern unbiassed. Some praise the belief in a moral doctrinal\ncode, which they naturally and continually transgress, and never\nobtain their purpose. Given the right nature, they succeed fairly in\ntheir own governing, and are those most healthy, sane and\nself-pleased. It may be called the negation of my doctrine, they\nobtain tolerable satisfaction, whereas mine is complete. Let him tarry\nhere, who is not strong for the great work. In freedom he might be\nlost. So fledge your wings fearlessly, ye humble ones!\n*(1) All means of locomotion, machinery, governments, institutions,\nand everything essentially modern, is vital symbolism of the workings\nof our mind, etc.\n*(2) The symbol of justice known to the Romans is not symbolic of\nDivine, or our justice, at least not necessarily or usually. The\nvitality is not exactly like water-nor are we trees; more like\nourselves, which might incidentally include trees somewhere\nunlearnt-much more obvious in our workings at present.\nOthers say knowledge only is eternal, it is the eternal illusion of\nlearning-the Ukase of learning what we already know. Directly we ask\nourselves \"how\" we induce stupidity; without this conception what is\nthere we could not know and accomplish? Others for concentration, it\nwill not free you, the mind conceiving the law is bondage. Arrived at\nthat, you will want deconcentration. Dissociation from all ideas but\none is not release but imaginative fulfilment, or the fury of\ncreation. Others again, that all things are emanations of the Divine\nSpirit, as rays from the Sun, hence the need of emancipation? Verily,\nthings are of necessity through their conception and belief. Then let\nus destroy or change conception, and empty the belief.\nThese and many other doctrines, are declared by me as the perpetuators\nof sin and illusion. Each and all depending on a muddled implication,\nobscuring, yet evolved from the duality of the consciousness for their\nenjoyment. In fear they would vomit hot blood were they to see the\nfruits of their actions and pleasures. Thus believing in widely\ndifferent doctrines, they are of the dual principle, necessary\nparasites on each other. Like drugs and the surgeon's knife, they only\nannul or at best remove an effect. They do not change or remove the\nfundamental cause (the law). \"Oh, God, thou art the stagnant\nenvironment.\" All is quackery: these religions whose very existence\ndepend on their failure, are so full of misery and confusion, have\nonly multiplied arguments, as full of argument as they are evil, so\ncrowded with non-essentials, being so barren of any free pleasure in\nthis life or another, I cannot uphold their doctrines. Their criterion\nfor enjoyment-death! Better it were a man renounce them all, and\nembrace his own invincible purpose. He cannot go further, and this is\nhis only release. By it he may put his pleasure where he will, and\nfind satisfaction.\nTHE CONSUMER OF RELIGION\nKia, in its Transcendental and Conceivable Manifestation.\nOf name it has no name, to designate. I call it Kia I dare not claim\nit as myself. The Kia which can be expressed by conceivable ideas, is\nnot the eternal Kia, which burns up all belief but is the archetype of\n\"self,\" the slavery of mortality. Endeavouring to describe \"it,\" I\nwrite what may be but not usually-called the \"book of lies\"*(1). The\nunorthodox of the originable-a volant \"sight,\" that conveys somehow by\nthe incidental, that truth is somewhere. The Kia which can be vaguely\nexpressed in words is the \"Neither-Neither,\" the unmodified \"I\" in the\nsensation of omnipresence, the illumination symbolically transcribed\nin the sacred alphabet, and of which I am about to write. Its\nemanation is its own intensity, but not necessariness, it has and ever\nwill exist, the virgin quantum-by its exuberance we have gained\nexistence. Who dare say where, why and how it is related? By the\nlabour of time the doubter inhabits his limit. Not related to, but\npermitting all things, it eludes conception, yet is the quintessence\nof conception as permeating pleasure in meaning. Anterior to Heaven\nand Earth, in its aspect that transcends these, but not intelligence,\nit may be regarded as the primordial sexual principle, the idea of\npleasure in self-love. Only he who has attained the death posture can\napprehend this new sexuality, and its almighty love satisfied. He that\nis ever servile to belief, clogged by desire, is identified with such\nand can see but its infinite ramifications in dissatisfaction*(2). The\nprogenitor of itself and all things, but resembling nothing, this\nsexuality in its early simplicity, embodies the everlasting. Time has\nnot changed it, hence I call it new. This ancestral sex principle, and\nthe idea of self, are one and the same, this sameness its exaction and\ninfinite possibilities, the early duality, the mystery of mysteries,\nthe Sphinx at the gates of all spirituality. All conceivable ideas\nbegin and end as light in its emotion, the ecstasy which the creation\nof the idea of self induces. The idea is unity by the formula of self,\nits necessary reality as continuity, the question of all things, all\nthis universe visible and invisible has come out of it. As unity\nconceived duality, it begot trinity, begot tetragrammaton. Duality\nbeing unity, is time, the complex of conception, the eternal\nrefluctuation to the primeval reality in freedom-being trinity of\ndualities, is the six senses, the five facets of sex-projecting as\nenvironment for self-assimilation in denial, as a complete\nsexuality. Being tetragrammaton of dualities is twelvefold by\narrangement, the human complex, and may be called the twelve\ncommandments of the believer. It imagines the eternal decimal, its\nmultiplicity embracing eternity, from which spring the manifold forms,\nwhich constitute existence. Vitalized by the breath of self-love, life\nis conscious of one. Self being its opposing force, is alternately\nconflict, harmony, life and death. These four principles are one and\nthe same-the conception considered as the complete \"self\" or\nconsciousness-hence they may be blended into unity and Symbolized. One\nform made by two, that is three-fold and having four directions.\n*(1) About this \"Self\"; all conception is the dual principle, the law\nwhich is its conception.\n*(2) The unmodified sex principle refracted through the dual principle\nemanates the infinite variety of emotions or sexualities, which may be\ncalled its ramifications.\nThe Transcendental Law, the Law and Testament of the \"New.\"\nThe law of Kia is its own arbiter, beyond necessitation, who can grasp\nthe nameless Kia? Obvious but unintelligible, without form, its design\nmost excellent. Its wish is its superabundance, who can assert its\nmysterious purpose? By our knowledge it becomes more obscure, more\nremote, and our faith-opacity. Without attribute, I know not its\nname. How free it is, it has no need of sovereignty! (Kingdoms are\ntheir own despoilers.) Without lineage, who dare claim relationship?\nWithout virtue, how pleasing in its moral self-love! How mighty is it,\nin its assertion of \"Need not be-Does not matter\"! Self-love in\ncomplete perspective, serves its own invincible purpose of\necstasy. Supreme bliss simulating opposition is its balance. It\nsuffers no hurt, neither does it labour. Is it not self-attracting and\nindependent? Assuredly we cannot call it balance. Could we but imitate\nits law, all creation without command would unite and serve our\npurpose in pleasure and harmony. Kia transcending conception, is\nunchanging and inexhaustible, there is no need of illumination to see\nit. If we open our mouths to speak of it, it is not of it but of our\nduality, mighty though it be in its early simplicity! Kia without\nconceiving, produces its rendezvous as the fulness of\ncreation. Without assertion the mightiest energy, without smallness it\nmay appear the least among things. Its possession ours without asking,\nits being free, the only thing that is free. Without distinction, it\nhas no favourites, but nourishes itself. In fear all creation pays\nhomage-but does not extol its moral, so everything perishes\nunbeautifully. We endow ourselves with the power we concieve of it,\nand it acts as master-*, never the cause of emancipation. Thus for\never from \"self\" do I fashion the Kia, without likeness, but which may\nbe regarded as the truth. From this consultation is the bondage made,\nnot by intelligence shall we be free. The law of Kia is its ever\noriginal purpose, undetermined, without change the emanations, through\nour conception they materialize and are of that duality, man takes\nthis law from this refraction, his ideas-reality. With what does he\nbalance his ecstasy? Measure for measure by intense pain, sorrow, and\nmiseries. With what his rebellion? Of necessity slavery! Duality is\nthe law, realization by suffering, relates and opposes by units of\ntime. Ecstasy for any length of time is difficult to obtain, and\nlaboured heavily for. Various degrees of misery alternating with gusts\nof pleasure and emotions less anxious, would seem the condition of\nconsciousness and existence. Duality in some form or another is\nconsciousness as existence. It is the illusion of time, size, entity,\netc.-the world's limit. The dual principle is the quintessence of all\nexperience, no ramification has enlarged its early simplicity, but is\nonly its repetition, modification or complexity, never is its\nevolution complete. It cannot go further than the experience of\nself-so returns and unites again and again, ever an anti-climax. For\never retrogressing to its original simplicity by infinite complication\nis its evolution. No man shall understand \"Why\" by its workings. Know\nit as the illusion that embraces the learning of all existence. The\nmost aged one who grows no wiser, it may be regarded as the mother of\nall things. Therefore believe all experience to be illusion, and the\nlaw of duality. As space pervades an object both in and out, similarly\nwithin and beyond this ever-changing cosmos, there is this secondless\nprinciple.\n* By scores of incarnations, our eventual \"self\" is derived from the\nattributes with which we endow our God, the abstract Ego or conceptive\nprinciple. All conception is a denial of the Kia, hence we are its\nopposition, our own evil. The offspring of ourselves, we are the\nconflict of what we deny and assert of the Kia. It would seem as\nthough we cannot be too careful in our choice, for it determines the\nbody we inhabit.\nSOLILOQUY ON GOD-HEAD.\nWho ever Thought Thus?\nSomething is causing Pain and something energizes the Agony: may it\nnot be caused through the latent Idea of Supreme Bliss? And this\neternal expectation, this amassing of ornament on decay, this\never-abiding thought- is coincidental with the vanity preceding death?\nO, squalid thought from the most morbid spleen how can I devour thee\nand save my Soul? Ever did it answer back-\"Pay homage where due: the\nPhysician is the Lord of existence!\" This superstition of medicine-is\nit not the essence of cowardice, the agent of Death?\nStrange no one remembers being dead? Have you ever seen the Sun?-If\nyou have then you have seen nothing dead-in spite of you different\nbelief! Which is the more dead \"you\" or this corpse? Which of you has\nthe greater degree of consciousness? Judging by expression alone-which\nof you appears enjoying Life most? May not this \"belief\" in death be\nthe \"will\" that attempts \"death\" for your satisfaction, but can give\nyou no more than sleep, decay, change-hell? This constant somnambulism\nis \"the unsatisfactory.\"\nYou disbelieve in Ghosts and God-because you have not seen them? What!\nYou have never seen the mocking ghosts of your beliefs?-the Laughing\nBedlam of your humility or Mammon-your grotesque Ideas of \"Self\"? Yea,\nyour very faculties and your most courageous Lies are Gods! Who is the\nslayer of your Gods-but a God!\nThere is no proof that you existed before? What an excuse! No one has\nreturned to tell us? What a damning advocate! You are but what you\nwere-somehow changed? You are the case Prima Facie that you are\nreincarnated to perhaps anything? \"Perhapses\" are possible! Can you do\ndifferently to what you do? Never shall I tire of asserting that you\nconstantly do differently!\nWhat is the \"ugliness\" that offends? Is it the vague knowledge that\nyou will have to change your mind-that you are germinating what you\ncontain? You are always remembering what you forgot; to-day may be the\nday of reckoning-of believing by force what you disbelieved? Now if\nto-day is yesterday in all but appearances-then to-morrow also is\nto-day- the day of decay! Daily is this universe destroyed, that is\nwhy you are conscious! There is no Life and Death? Such ideas should\nbe less than comic.\nThere is no Duality?\nYou are conscious of the gay Butterfly you observe and are conscious\nof being \"You\": the Butterfly is conscious of being \"itself,\" and as\nsuch, it is a consciousness as good as and the same as yours, i.e., of\nyou being \"you.\" Therefore this consciousness of \"you\" that you both\nfeel is the same \"you\"? Ergo, you are one and the same-the mystery of\nmysteries and the most simple thing in the world to understand! How\ncould you be conscious of what you are not? But you might believe\ndifferently? So, if you hurt the Butterfly you hurt yourself, but your\nbelief that you don't hurt yourself protects you from hurt-for a time!\nBelief gets tired and you are miserably hurt! Do what you will-belief\nis ever its own inconsistency. Desire contains everything, hence you\nmust believe in everything-if you believe at all! Belief seems to\nexclude commonsense.\nnThere is no doubt about it-this consciousness of \"Thee\" and \"Me\" is\nthe unwelcome but ever ready torturer-yet it \"need not be so\" in any\nsense! Is it not a matter of Fear? You are fearsome of entering a den\nof Tigers? (And I assure you it is a matter of righteousness-(inborn\nor cultured)-whether you enter voluntarily or are chucked in, and\nwhether you come out alive or not!) Yet daily you fearlessly enter\ndens inhabited by more terrible creatures than Tigers and you come out\nunharmed-why?\nThe Allegory.\nGreat scientists are finding out the death-dealing properties of the\nmicrobes they discover we breathe, and which according to their canons\nshould destroy; we should be already dead? Have faith! The canons of\nscience are quite correct, they do not disappoint the doubt! Our\ngreater familiarity-\"this impulse to knowledge\" will certainly bring\nus the disease and death they give! And also give us in compensation\ntheir powers of destruction! For the destruction of whom? Things will\nbe squared! Is this the value of the will? This \"will to power\"-how\nlife preserving! How furthering of discriminate selection! How\npleasing! Most noble explorers! O, you scientists-go on discovering\nthe Bottomless Pit! When you are sodden with science-the lightning\nwill thunder out the murder? New hope will be born? New creatures for\nthe circus? (The conception of) God-head must ever evolve its inertia\nfor transmutation to its very opposite-because it contains it!\nThe master must be the painful learner of his stupidity?\nThe idea of God ever means the forgetfulness of supremacy and\nGodliness.

When\nthe conception is memorial in forgetfulness-it may be the chance of\nits reality for you??

What a somersault of humility!\nWhether God is projected as master by fear or as the dweller within by\nlove Gods we are all the time, that is why divinity is always\npotential. Its constant generation, the eternal delay-is life. This\nenvy of the Master or Creator-the ultimate hope to follow in manner is\nalso existence and the forfeiture of \"Life\"!\nThere is no scientific fact, it ever implies its opposite as equal\nfact, this is the \"fact.\" Then why trouble to prove anything a fact?\nThis vain hope to prove finality is death itself, so why humbug the\n\"Desire\"? You have proved (by mathematics!) the sun to be so many\nmillions of miles away from you-you will now improve its efficiency!\nNature-that impulse to the antitheses of your truths, will early prove\n(by mathematics and whenever you like!) that the Sun does not exist at\nall! Or if you wish-it will prove conclusively that the Sun is\nmillions of millions of miles further away or millions of miles nearer\nthan you once thought! Most extraordinary thinker!

This consciousness is ever the\nsmiling monument commemorating \"Whether you ever really enjoyed Life\"!\nThe God of the \"Will\" is the command to obey, its Justice everyone\nfears-it is a Sword-your desert for obedience! \"Will\" is the command\nto believe, your will is what you have believed actively willing the\nbelief for you! You think when \"it\" wishes! \"Will\" is complication,\nthe means of a means. Call this will free or not-beyond will and\nbelief is Self-love. I know of no better name. It is free to believe\nwhat it desires. You are free to believe in nothing related to\nbelief. The \"Truth\" is not difficult to understand! The truth has no\nwill-will has no truth! Truth is \"will\" never believed-it has no\ntruth! \"Could be\"-is the immediate certainty! This haunting Sphinx\nteaches us the value of the \"will to anything\"? Then there is no\ngraver risk than Absolute Knowledge-if little is dangerous-what about\nOmniscience? The Almighty power has no accessories!\nScience is the accursed doubt of the possible, yea, of what does\nexist! You cannot conceive an impossibility, nothing is impossible,\nyou are the impossible! Doubt is delay-time-but how it punishes!\nNothing is more true than anything else! What are you not-you ever\nanswered truthfully?\nYou tyrannise over yourself, so constantly forget what you remember;\nyou resist sense objects and show resistance to the faculties by\nbelieving or not. These faculties are as numerous as the atoms you\nhave not yet seen, and they are as endless as the number one-they come\ninto life at will. You adopt a few at a time- knowledge you speak\nthrough them- did you but understand your grammar those you disown\nspeak louder than your words! I would not believe the wisdom of the\nAlmighty.\nBelief is ever its own tempter to believe differently; you cannot\nbelieve freedom but you may be freed from belief? Neither can you\nbelieve the \"Truth\" but you need not compromise yourself. The way of\nLife is not by \"means\"-these doctrines-my doctrines even though they\nallow the self-appointed devotee to emulate my realization- may I ever\nblush! The man of sorrows is the Teacher! I have taught- would I teach\nmyself or thee again? Not for a gift from Heaven! Mastership equals\nlearning- equals constant unlearning! Almighty is he who has not\nlearnt and mighty is the babe- it has only the power of assimilating!\nThe most solecistical of fools now asks-\"how can we escape the\ninevitable evolutions of conception-as all is ever conceiving\"? My\nanswer shall permit all means, all men, all conditions. Listen, O, God\nthat art, yet would be God. When the mind is nonplussed- capability to\nattempt the impossible becomes known; by that most simple state of\n\"Neither-Neither\" the Ego becomes the Silent Watcher and knows about\nit all! The \"Why\" and \"How\" of desire is contained within the mystic\nstate of \"Neither-Neither\" and common-sense proves it is the milk\nstate, most nutritious! Clownish that I am- yet all my ideas have come\nout of it (and, my friend, all yours), but ever have I been a\nsluggard- an old sinner who would see others almighty before himself.\nTHE DEATH POSTURE\nIdeas of Self in conflict cannot be slain, by resistance they are a\nreality- no Death or cunning has overcome them but is their\nreinforcement of energy. The dead are born again and again lie in the\nwomb of conscience. By allowing maturity is to predicate decay when by\nnon-resistance is retrogression to early simplicity and the passage to\nthe original and unity without idea. From that idea is the formula of\nnon-resistance germinating \"Does not matter- please yourself.\"\nThe conception of \"I am not\" must of necessity follow the conception\nof \"I am,\" because of its grammar, as surely in this world of sorrow\nnight follows day. The recognition of pain as such, implies the idea\nof pleasure, and so with all ideas. By this duality, let him remember\nto laugh at all times, recognize all things, resist nothing; then\nthere is no conflict, incompatibility or compulsion as such.\nTransgressing Conception by a Lucid Symbolism.\nMan implies Woman, I transcend these by the Hermaphrodite, this again\nimplies a Eunuch*(1); all these conditions I transcend by a \"Neither\"\nprinciple, yet although a \"Neither\" is vague, the fact of conceiving\nit proves its palpability, and again implies a different\n\"Neither.\"*(2)\nBut the \"Neither-Neither\" principle of those two, is the state where\nthe mind has passed beyond conception, it cannot be balanced, since it\nimplies only itself. The \"I\" principle has reached the \"Does not\nmatter- need not be\" state, and is not related to form. Save and\nbeyond it, there is no other, therefore it alone is complete and\neternal. Indestructible, it has power to destroy- therefore it alone\nis true freedom and existence. Through it comes immunity from all\nsorrow, therefore the spirit is ecstasy. Renouncing everything by the\nmeans shown, take shelter in it. Surely it is the abode of Kia? This\nhaving once been (even Symbolically) reached, is our unconditional\nrelease from duality and time- believe this to be true. The belief\nfree from all ideas but pleasure, the Karma through law (displeasure)\nspeedily exhausts itself. In that moment beyond time, a new law can\nbecome incarnate, without the payment of sorow, every wish gratified,\nhe*(3) having become the gratifier by his law. The new law shall be\nthe arcana of the mystic unbalanced \"Does not mattter- need not be,\"\nthere is no necessitation, \"please yourself\" is its creed.*(4)\nIn that day there can be deliberation. Without subjection, what you\nwish to believe can be true. \"He\"*(5) is pleased by this imitation,\nthe truth revealed to me by all systems of government but is himself\nungoverned; Kia, the supreme bliss. This the glorious Science of\npleasing one's self by a new agreement, the art of Self-love by\nrecognition, the Psychology of ecstasy by non-resistance.\n*(1) Sex-less.\n*(2) They being dual have analogy to certain early sex principles in\nnature. They are carried further in the sacred alphabet, being too\nabstruse to explain by orthodox words and grammar.\n*(3) The Ego.\n*(4) The belief ever striving for denial- fulness by multiplication,\nis kept free by retention in this.\n*(5) \"He\", the Ego, now becomes the \"Absolute.\"\nThe Ritual and Doctrine\nLying on your back lazily, the body expressing the condition of\nyawning, suspiring while conceiving by smiling, that is the idea of\nthe posture. Forgetting time with those things which were essential-\nreflecting their meaninglessness, the moment is beyond time and its\nvirtue has happened.\nStanding on tip-toe, with the arms rigid, bound behind by the hands,\nclasped and straning the utmost, the neck streched- breathing deeply\nand spasmodically, till giddy and sensation comes in gusts, gives\nexhaustion and capacity for the former.\nGazing at your reflection till it is blurred and you know not the\ngazer, close your eyes (this usually happens involuntarily) and\nvisualize. The light (always an X in curious evolutions) that is seen\nshould be held on to, never letting go, till the effort is forgotten,\nthis gives a feeling of immensity (which sees a small form ), whose\nlimit you cannot reach. This should be practised before experiencing\nthe foregoing. The emotion that is felt is the knowledge which tells\nyou why.\nThe death posture is its inevitability accelerated, through it we\nescape our unending delay by attachment, the Ego is swept up as a leaf\nin a fierce gale- in the fleetness of the indeterminable, that which\nis always about to happen becomes its truth. Things that are\nself-evident are no longer obscure, as by his own will he pleases,\nknow this as the negation of all faith by living it, the end of the\nduality of the consciousness. Of belief, a positive death state, all\nelse as sleep, a negative state. It is the dead body of all we\nbelieve, and shall awake a dead corpse. The Ego in subjection to law,\nseeks inertion in sleep and death. Know the death posture and its\nreality in annihilation of law- the ascension from duality. In that\nday of tearless lamentation the universe shall be reduced to ashes .\n. . . but he escapes the judgment! And what of \"I,\" most\nunfortunate man! In that freedom there is no necessitation, what dare\nI say more? Rather would I commit much sin than compromise\nmyself. There are many preliminary exercises, as innumerable as sins,\nfutile of themselves but designative of the ultimate means. The death\nposture in the reduction of all conception (sin) to the\n\"Neither-Neither\" till the desire is contentment by pleasing\nyourself. By this and by no other are the inertia of belief; the\nrestoration of the new sexuality and the ever original self-love in\nfreedom are attained. The primordial vacuity (or belief) is not by the\nexercise of focussing the mind on a negation of all conceivable\nthings, the identity of unity and duality, chaos and uniformity, etc.,\netc., but by doing it now, not eventually. Percieve, and feel without\nthe necessity of an opposite, but by its relative. Percieve light\nwithout shadow by its own colour as contrast, through evoking the\nemotion of laughter at the time of ecstasy in union, and by practice\ntill that emotion is untiring and subtle. The law or reaction is\ndefeated by inclusion. Were he to enjoy an hundred pleasures at a\ntime, however much his ecstasy, he does not lose, but great increase\ntakes place. Let him practise it daily, accordingly, till he arrives\nat the centre of desire. He has imitated the great purpose. Like this,\nall emotions should find equipoise at the time of emanation, till they\nbecome one. Thus by hindering belief and semen from conception, they\nbecome simple and cosmic. By its illumination there is nothing that\ncannot be explained. Certainly I find satisfaction in ecstasy. I have\nnow told you a secret of great import, it was known to me in\nchildhood. Even by sedulously striving for a vacuity of belief, one is\ncosmic enough to dwell in the innermost of others and enjoy\nthem. Among men few know what they really believe or desire, let him\nbegin, who would know, by locating his belief till he sees his\nwill. Existing as dual, they are identical in desire, by their duality\nthere is no control, for will and belief are ever at variance, and\neach would shape the other to its ends, in the issue neither wins as\nthe joy is a covert of sorrow. Let him unite them.\nTHE CLOUDY ENEMIES BORN OF STAGNANT SELF-HYPNOTISM.\nNatural belief is the intuition that compels belief through that which\nis experienced reacting, and dominating in turns; everything has to\nassociate itself through its definite emotion, stimulated by those in\nharmony; those discordant, lose cogency and inhibit. So by its own\nworkings belief is limited and determined for you. The majority of our\nactions can be traced back to a subconscious desire (for freedom) in\nconflict with habit, an obedience to inherent fatalism which hangs on\n\"good and bad\" actions already committed (in past existence) against a\npreserved morality* and whose reaction gives expression as\nspontaneity, involuntariness, autonomy, the deliberate, etc., as the\nchance arises. The rest is due to a conflicting traditional moral\ndoctrine that has become constitutional (partly adopted to govern and\ntime this reaction). In its origin, an idea of what was then\nconsidered conveniently good and bad . . . . To maximize pleasure\nby an arbitrary compromise of abstention and performance of desire\nfeared. Assimilated by the deceit of its divine origin, its tenets are\nreward for obedience, punishment for transgression, both holding good\nfor all time (this world and another). This moral code is a\ndramatised burlesque of the conceptive faculty, but is never so\nperfect or simple in that it allows latitude for change in any sense,\nso becomes dissociated from evolution, etc; and this divorce loses any\nutility and of necessity for its own preservation and the sympathy\ndesired, evolves contradictions or a complication to give\nrelationship. Transgressing its commandments, dishonesty shows us its\niniquity, for our justification; or simultaneously we create an excuse\nor reason for the sin by a distortion of the moral code, that allows\nsome incongruity. (Usually retaing a few unforgiveable sins- and an\nunwritten law.) This negative confession is a feigned rationalism that\nallows adventitious excuses . . . . a process of self-deception to\nsatisfy and summarily persuade yourself of righteousness. What one\namong us has any excuse but self-love? We do not create or confess a\nmorality that is convenient, that lends itself to growth, and remains\nsimple, that allows transgression without excuse or punishment. It\nwould be wise and commonsense to do so, whatever the state of affairs\nin your mind. Nature eventually denies that which it affirms: Through\npermanent association with the same moral code we help desire to\ntransgress. Desire of those things denied, the more you restrict the\nmore you sin, but desire equally desires preservation of moral\ninstinct, so desire is its own conflict (and weakly enough). Have no\nfear, the Bull of earth has long had nothing to do with your unclean\nconscience, your stagnant ideas of morality. The microbe alone would\nseem without fear!\n* The elemental morality or fear of displeasing.\nThe Complexity of the Belief (Know Thyself).\nThe nature of belief equals all possibilities ultimately true by\nidentification through culture to an idea of time, so what is not\ntimely is not true, and what is not true, prognostication. Thought of\none thing, implies the possibility of another idea as contradicting\nbut not dissociated, belief is to make \"one\" more convincing. The\ncondition of belief is the denial or limit imposed on the capability\nof the vitality. To believe at all as such is a concentration and\nschooling to exclude the implied by adopting a hypothesis or faith\nthat reflects non-worryingly or deceitfully rationalizes the\nrejected. Truth is not the truth of formula.\nThe centre of belief is love for one's self, projecting environment\nfor fulfilment but allowing its distortion to simulate denial, an\nambition to become ulterior to self-desire, but you cannot get further\nthan the centre, so one multiplies (believes) in order to be more\nunaware of the fundamental. Now this refusal to believe what one\nbelieves and exactly as one believes, is the first condition for all\nthose who are in desire in any sense whatsoever; the man who is in\nlove perforce becomes a liar, self-hypnotised by his morbid\nornamentation. You know the results. . . . .You can only \"truly\nbelieve\" one thing, yet its implexion is essential (as the truth seems\nto kill*), so the imagined goes on for ever. The imagination learns\nthat the idea is its compulsion. To explain the \"why\" of belief (or of\nanything else), we must transcend its schism. By entire consciousness\nin how the self loves is the means. As we imitate this law of duality\nin all our processes of believing, it is not so simple as it\nseems. Who has transgressed the law of conception? Who has no fear?\nYet by this sin, is the sciential of what determines the\nSchetic. Gracefully compelling or expecting disappointment at the time\nof desire is the means of locating its deceit, a consciousness that\nalone gives the chance of inquiry. Beyond it is something arbitrary,\nthe pauser, the ordainer of law, imitating it by \"reason\" is but\ndamning the consequences. Reason is belief, belief is fear of one's\ncapability, the faith that you are not even all the wonders of\ncreation, let alone the possibility of being the creator. It is delay\n. . . . Belief well earns the terrible hatred of the\nvitality. Belief is not freedom. Belief creates its necessary\nexperience, progress germinates in retrogression. Consider the reality\nis somewhere: and your belief may be too small for its habitation. Oh,\nye of much faith in God, merge into it by the worship of self! Ah!\nfoolish man, worship the glorious in freedom. When death approaches\nthe faith in God and desire of woman will not save you, what are their\nuse when withering and decay sets in and the body is an object of\ndisgust? And what is the use of knowledge and charity when reality is\nknown? Unsheathe the sword of self; ideas of the Almighty should be\nconstantly slain and righteousness should be inquired into.\n* And does kill when feared.\nWhosoever shall study his true nature a little, him does the \"self\"\ninvestigate with his extraordinary conduct. He can compel anything\nwithout offending. As the tendency of the most lustful ceases before\npublicity and death, so do morals and faith before the perfect\nbliss. A glimpse of the truth is born of purity of love: when the\ndesire is without fear, when it does not desire possession. When the\nthought is fulfilled by vision. The fire that is all pleasure is\nloosed at his will, he is attraction, the cynosure of women. When the\nbelieving principle is devoid of faith, as sterile of possessing ideas\nof God - he is indestructible. Only when there is no fear in any form\nis there realisation of identity with reality (freedom). For them\nthere is no danger in negligence, there being no discrimination. For\nhim who is conscious of the slightest differentiation there is\nfear. So long as there is perception of self-reproach or conscience,\nthere is pain germinating: there is no freedom. He who believes\nanything he perceives or imagines, falls into sin. By believing\nwithout feeling perturbation, forgetting ideas of external and\ninternal, he regards everything as self, and is the consciousness of\nnon-resistance, has no horizon: he is free. On seeing the star-lit\neyes and rosebud mouths, the breasts and loins of beautiful women, you\nbecome lovingly attached, but if you fear, consider constantly that\nthey are merely the charred flesh and bones of yourself after the\ntorture. The space between the eternal and \"self,\" is it not a moral\ndoctrine? By unbelieving all one believes and sedulously without\nanxiety not believing (by the \"Neither-Neither\" process), the\nprinciple becomes simple and cosmic enough to include what you are\nalways desiring, and you are free to believe what was impossible. The\ndesire is so mighty, it asks no permission, and suffers no\nconsequences, but the ecstasy of its possession. Against it nothing\ncan prevail, it burns up, as celluloid cast into the furnace- the old\nfolly of promising things on behalf of an imagined \"another.\" At hand\nis the freedom of Heaven, the Way, the Truth, and the Light, and none\ndare say this of himself but by me, in Truth I alone am \"Self,\" my\nwill unconditioned, is magical. Those who have lived much in their\nnature will in some degree be familiar with such a sensation, poor\nthough it be.\nPREFACE TO SELF-LOVE\nLet us be honest! Thou art \"that,\" supreme in freedom, most desirable,\nbeyond desire, untouched by the six stupifiers. The sexuality labours,\nso Death may harvest by desire. The elusive fancies of the senses are\ndangerous, because of the righteousness you have learned to obey and\ncontrol them by. Hell-fire burns because you \"conceived\"; and will\ncease to hurt when you identify the Ego with all the possibilities of\nits qualities by believing as the \"Neither-Neither\" process. You are\nfire yet you are scorched! Because you have \"willed\" belief\n(differently or not makes no difference); the cycle of belief goes on\nand always obliges, so one day you must believe differently and the\nfire will no longer hurt- you are saved? There are other means of\nhurting you?\nIn that state which is not, there is no consciousness in any sense\nthat thou art \"that\" (Kia), which is superb, beyond the range of\ndefinition: there is no temptation of freedom, \"it\" was not the cause\nof evolution. Hence \"it\" is beyond time, consciousness or\nunconsciousness, everything or nothingness, etc.; this I know through\nthe \"Neither-Neither\" which is automatically beyond every conception,\never free in every sense. Perhaps \"it\" may not be obscure by continual\nafterthought and vaguely felt through the hand of innocence- but\nwhoever understands such simple meanings? \"It\" is never perceived,\nbeing the imperceptible Ecstasy of the \"Neither-Neither\"- ever present\nbut hidden by exhaustion through the cycle of Unity. The certainty of\nconsciousness is always the uncertainty of the perceived or\nexperienced in whatever state it may be, the constant doubt spelling\nfear, pain, decay, and the like- the cause of evolution, the eternal\nincompletion.\nO, desire, listen! In point of virulence spiritual desire is as fatal\nas the sensuous. Aspiration towards a \"supreme\" is a network of deadly\ndesires because of cowardice within, ergo, some unsatisfied wisdom\nawaiting exploitation to suffer its evolutions. There is no final\nwisdom- there is no final desire. How can anything end? Has to-day\never ended? These things are endlessness!\nA person desires things of this world- but where is the difference of\ndesiring the \"Supreme Bliss\"? Which is the more selfish? Which is\nnearer you? Which pleases the Creator more? Are you certain of the\nCreator's will and are you sure of your own desire? Are you the\nCreator or just yourself, as you fondly imagine your contents?\nAll these desires, however mighty, you will one day incarnate- yea,\nphotograph. These things already exist- very soon you will have\nspiritual photographs (unfaked) but not by the camera you use at\npresent. The pioneer is ever the old fool. An afterthought: some\nspirits are already photographed- the microbes.\nAre you ever free of desideratum? Belief is eternal desire!\nDesire is its own cruelty, the fettering of the hand to labour in some\nworld unknown; nothing is always dead and no thought dies, the master\nbecomes the slave- the position is alternate; you have long believed\nthis, it is in the flesh of your generations with the most merciless\nJudge! The scorn of all your reforms or the inversion of your values!\nThis constant curse and blasphemy- is not the relief more in the\nknowledge of the nascent unrelenting taskmaster?\nAre not our bodies all smeared with its blood? Has not the world ever\nbeen bloody? Are not our pleasures but rest to drink the blood of\nslaughter? O, determined Liars, ye know not yet the lie, it may be\nTruth!\nThe Ego is desire, so everything is ultimately desired and\nundesirable, desire is ever a preliminary forecast of terrible\ndissatisfaction hidden by its ever-present vainglory. The millenium\nwill come and quickly go. Men will be greater than the Gods they ever\nconceived- there will be greater dissatisfaction. You are ever what\nyou were but you may be so in a different form!\nA person or a nation, however vain or content, falls immediately into\nunknown and inevitable desire, consuming him little by little through\nthose conditions- any condition!\nThe mind becomes firm in desire by desire as devotion, but when\nrealized is it then eternally desirable? (or even for a period of a\nmillion years). In Heaven shall be fettered thy foot! Therefore remove\nthe conception that desire is pure, or impure, or has completion-\nremove it by the \"Neither-Neither.\" Even whether the desire is for the\nexhasustion of desire by the \"neither-Neither\" or for realization in a\nwife- it is desire- its unending evolution. Therefore remove desire in\nany form by the \"Neither-Neither.\" Remove the illusion that there is\nSpirit and Not-Spirit (this idea has never given beneficial\nresults). Remove all conceptions by the same means.\nSo long as the notion remains that there is \"compulsory bondage\" in\nthis World or even in dreams there is such bondage. Remove the\nconception of Freedom and Bondage in any World or State by meditation\non Freedom in Freedom by the \"Neither-Neither.\"\nFor this we know- Vampirism is quite well proven enough- even by the\nstrong presumption that whenever blood-sucking is done, it is done by\nVampire bats apart from the probability of it being done by a divine\nor human agency!\nTherefore Kiaize desire by the \"Neither-Neither,\" the most excellent\nformula far beyond contentment- the all-embracing vacuum which reduces\n\"all\" to common sense and upon which this Universe rests.\nTherefore believe nothing in this Book by the \"Neither-Neither,\" and\ndispel the conception of the \"Neither-Neither\" by the\n\"Neither-Neither,\" and belive it is \"not-necessary\" or the conclusion\nof pleasing yourself, because it \"Need-not-be-Does-not-matter.\"\nOne believes this \"all the time\" as the Truth of \"The Will\" not the\nthing believed, since the means to an end mean evolution to endless\nmeans.\nIn that most remarkable simplicity there is no beginning or end of\nwisdom or of anything, so how can it be related to conception and\nintelligence?\nSELF-LOVE AS A MORAL DOCTRINE AND VIRTUE.\nThe criterion of action, is freedom of movement, timeliness of\nexpression, pleasuring. The value of a moral doctrine is in its\nfreedom for transgression. Simplicity I hold most precious. Are not\nthe most simple things in the world the most perfect, pure, innocent,\nand their properties the most wonderful? Hence it is the source of\nwisdom. Wisdom is exactly happiness. In love pleasuring myself\nnecessarily without excuse. Is this not perfection? Actions would\nappear unfathomable and incomprehensible, did they exhibit conformity\nto the great purpose. There are few who can attain to this! Who has no\nshame? Ecstasy in satisfaction is the great purpose. Freedom from the\nnecessity of law, realisation by the very wish, is the ultimate\ngoal. Law depends on two, two is uberty, millions . . . . Law is\ncomplicated. The second did not agitate, the first did not determine,\nnor was it compelled or proffered. Chance in sport is not prophecy; by\nit we have gained proficiency, sufficient to determine. . . . .\nPrepare for the Eternal, revert to simplicity and you are free. What\nman can give without impulse? Only he who has complete sexuality. The\nhighest goodness is self-nourishment. What are we going to include as\nself? Perfect charity acquires, hence it benefits all things by not\ngiving. What man can have faith without fear? Only he who has no duty\nto perform. When faith perishes duty to moral doctrines perishes, we\nare without sin and endure for ever in all-devouring love. What man\ncan know with certainty? Only he who has effaced the necessity of\nlearning. When teachers fall out, what is the use of learning from\nthem? The wise are not contentious and have no dogma to expound . .\n. . rather are they silent as a new-born babe in feeding. What\nteacher can show the source of wisdom? It is because I know without\nlearning; I know the source and can convey lessons without\nteaching. Knowledge is but the excrement of experience: experience its\nown repetition. The true teacher implants no knowledge but shows him\nhis own superabundance. Keeping his vision clear he directs or leads\nhim as a child to the essential. Having shown him the source of\nwisdom, he retires before gratitude or sentiment sets in, leaving him\nto fertilize as he wishes. Is not this the way of Heaven? He who\ntrusts to his natural fund of genius, has no knowledge of its extent\nand accomplishes with ease, but directly he doubts, ignorance obsesses\nhim. Doubt fertilizes in the virgin soil. He is no longer fearless but\na coward to difficulties, his very learning is fear. The difference\nbetween genius and ignorance is a degree of fear. The beginning of\nwisdom is fear of forethought the reception of knowledge in\nlearning. Children doubt, and abhor learning. Why, even the affection\nof courage results in cleverness! The difference between good and evil\nis a matter of profundity. Which is nearer you, self-love and its\nimmorality or love and morals? Not conscious of desert the compeer of\nHeaven, and constant happiness in wisdom is the capacity of\ndirection. From self-glorification, from self-exaltation we rise\nsuperior to the incapacity of disquieting fear: the ridiculer to\ndestruction of humility in repentance. This \"self-love\" that does not\ngive but is glad to receive is the genuine opportunity for freedom\nfrom covetousness, from the militant amusement of Heaven. He who\nsubordinates animal instincts to reason, quickly loses control. Are\nnot the animals we see in circuses trained by torture? And do not the\nanimals reared in love, slay their master? The wise embraces and\nnourishes all things, but does not act as master. Only when passions\nare ruled by foreign environment are they dangers. Control is by\nleaving things to work out their own salvation- directly we interfere\nwe become identified with and subject to their desire. When the Ego\nsees self-love- there is peace it becomes the seer. Directly we\ndesire, we have lost all; \"we are\" what we desire, therefore we never\nobtain. Desire nothing, and there is nothing that you shall not\nrealise. Desire is for completion, the inherent emotion that it is\n\"all happiness,\" all wisdom, in constant harmony. But directly we\nbelieve, we are liars- and become identified with pain, yet pain and\npleasure are one and the same. Therefore believe nothing, and you will\nhave reverted to a simplicity which childhood has not yet\nattained. The fool asks how? as we must believe in pleasure and\npain. Now if we could suffer them simultaneously (pain and pleasure)\nand hold fast to a principle that ascends, that allows the Ego\nvibration above them, should we not have reached the ecstasy? Now the\nbelief is the \"Ego,\" yet separates it from Heaven as your body\nseparates you from another's. . . . . Therefore by retaining the\nbelief in the \"not necessity\" (when conceiving), the Ego is free. The\nemotion of laughter is exhaustion, the early suffering hence by making\nthis emotion a \"mental state\" at the time of unity* he unites pain and\npleasure, suffers them simultaneously and by the \"not necessity\" of\nhis belief, his conception transcends this world and reaches the\nabsolute ecstasy. There is no place where pain or death can enter.\n* Of Sex, indeed of everything.\nThe idea of God is the primordial sin, all religions are\nevil. Self-love is its own law, which may be broken with impunity,\nbeing the only energy that is not servile, serving its ever-ready\npurpose. Surely it is all that is left us that has no sin and is free?\nVerily, it is the only thing we dare be conscious of. He that truly\npleases himself is wihout virtue, and shall satisfy all men. Hate,\njealousy, murder, etc., are conditions of love, even as virtue, greed,\nselfishness, suicide, etc., are conditions or not pleasing ones's\nself. There is no sin more sickening than love, for it is the very\nessence of covetousness and the mother of all sin, hence it has the\nmost devotees. Self-love only is pure and without a congregation.\nHe that entirely loves himself induces self-love only. In this he is\ninexorable, but does not offend like other men. He is akin to the\ngreat purpose, his actions explained for him, good seen of his evil,\nwithout knowing, everyone satisfied with his will. Do not Heaven and\nEarth unite daily in spontaneous homage to this will of self-love? No\nman can show greater self-love, than by giving up all he believes. Why\ndo I value this self-love before all else? Is it not because I may be\nfree to believe in evil, but have no thought that anything can do me\ninjury? All is self-love, the people of the world, if they only knew,\nare its devotees. My new law is the great clue to life. If the world\ncould understand this, the rotten fabric discarded, they would\ndiligently follow the way in their own hearts, there would be no\nfurther desire for unity. . . . . Try and imagine what that\nimplies.\nMay the idea of God perish and with it women: have they not both made\nme appear clownish? Let there be no mistake, purity and innocence is\nsimplicity, happiness is wisdom. What is simple has no duality.\nTHE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL SELF-LOVE.\nNow self-love is explained. It is the completion of belief. The \"self\"\nis the \"Neither-Neither,\" nothing omitted, indissoluble, beyond\nprepossession; dissociation of conception by its own invincible love\nis the only true, safe, and free. The desire, will, and belief ceasing\nto exist as separate. Attraction, repulsion, and control self\ncontained, they become the original unity, inert in pleasure. There is\nno duality. There is no desire for unity. At that time, it (the dual\nprinciple) rests in its unmodified state. The belief no longer subject\nto conception by conceiving \"self\" as such by loving. At other times,\nit*(1) creates a centre, becomes its environment, identified with its\nramifications, conception created, subjection to law and the\ninsatiable desire for unity, inasmuch as the duality is\nunity. Servitude to law is the hatred of Heaven. Self-love only is the\neternal all pleasing, by meditation on this effulgent self which is\nmystic joyousness. At that time of bliss, he is punctual to his\nimagination, in that day what happiness is his! A lusty innocent,\nbeyond sin, without hurt! Balanced by an emotion, a refraction of his\necstasy is all that he is conscious of as external.*(2) His vacuity\ncauses double refraction, \"He,\" the self-effulgent lightens in the\nEgo. Beyond law and the guest at the \"Feast of the\nSupersensualists.\"*(3) He has power over life and death.*(4) Save by\nthis, he is not beyond self-reproach, verily he has loosed all the\ntrouble of the world, the murder from the lightning. Self-love\npreventing the mind from concentration, is identity without form, is\nno thought as such; law and external influences contained, do not\naffect. When that giving up all belief, reflects only its meaning,\nthen is there purity of vision, innocence of touch, ergo,\nself-love. Verily, verily men are born, suffer and die through their\nbelief. Ejaculation is death. Self-love is preservation and life.\n*(1) It the \"Neither-Neither\" emanates tetragrammaton of relatives,\nthe sexes of which are evolved through their cruciform reflection and\nare elusive to identity. In their XXXX they produce unity XXXXX XXXXX\nconception. Ego generating by subdivision they embrace eternity, in\ntheir manifold ramifications is law.\n*(2) i.e. his rainbow.\n*(3) Chapter on self-attraction omitted.\n*(4) This is the test. The one who doubt would naturally submit himself.\nMan to invoke pleasure in his choice, subtracts from desire, his\ndesire is partial desire, becomes sub-duple (conflict), never is his\nenergy full. Having no true focus, he is deceived in his strength and\nattains a pure measure of pleasure from his body. In success how heavy\nis his sentence! Pleasure becomes the illusion. Through dire\nnecessity, \"his means,\" he is bound to its cause and effect, and\nbecomes a holcaust on the pyre of sentiment. This self-love is the\nonly full energy, all else a wrapping of dissatisfaction, the\nhypothesis of desires which obscures.\nMan in the misery of his illusions and unsatisfied desires, wings his\nflight to different religions, and doctrines, seeks redeception, a\nhypnotic, a palliative from which he suffers fresh miseries in\nexhaustion. The terms of the cure are new illusions, greater\nentanglement, more stagnant environment.\nHaving studied all ways and means to pleasure and pondered over them\nwell again and again, this self-love has been found by me to be the\nonly free, true and full one, nothing more sane, pure, and\ncomplete. There is no deceit: when by this all experience certainly is\nknown, everything sublimely beautiful and exceedingly amiable: where\nis the necessity of other means? Like the drink to the drunkard\neverything should be sacrificed for it. This Self-love is now declared\nby me the means of evolving millions of ideas for pleasure without\nlove, or its synonyms- self-reproach, sickness, old-age, and\ndeath. The Symposium of self and love. O! Wise Man, Please Thyself.\nTHE COMPLETE RITUAL AND DOCTRINE OF MAGIC\nEcstasy in Self-love the Obsession\nMy dearest, I will now explain the only safe and true formula, the\ndestroyer of the darkness of the World, the most secret among all\nsecrets. Let it be secret to him who would attain. Let it cover any\nperiod of time, depending on his conception. There is no\nqualification*(1), nor ritual or ceremony. His very existence\nsymbolising all that is necessary to perfection. Most emphatically,\nthere is no need of repetition or feeble imitation. You are alive!\nMagic, the reduction of properties to simplicity, making them\ntransmutable to utilise them afresh by direction, without\ncapitalization, bearing fruit many times. Know deliberation, over\nconsciousness and concentration to be its resistance and sycophancy,\nthe ultimate acquirement of idiotcy. Whether for his own pleasure or\npower, the fulfilment of desire is his purpose, he would terminate\nthis by magic. Let him wait for a desire analogous in intensity*(2),\nhe then sacrifices this desire (or its fulfilment) to the initial\ndesire, by this it becomes organic, the quantum. He has not attained\nfreedom from law* (3). Hence let him wait for a belief to be\nsubtracted, that period when disillusionment has taken\nplace*(4). Verily disappointment is his chance. \"This free entity of\nbelief\" and his desire are united to his purpose by the use of Sigils\nor sacred letters. By projecting the consciousness into one part,\nsensation not being manifold, becomes intensified. By the abstention\nof desire, except in the object, this is attained (at the\npsychological time this determines itself).\nBy non-resistance (involuntary thought and action), worry and\napprehension of non-fulfilment, being transient, find no permanent\nabode: he desires everything. Anxiety defeats the purpose, it retains\nand exposes the desire. Conscious desire is non-attractive. The mind\nquiet and focussed, undisturbed by external images does not distort\nthe sense impressions (there is no hallucination; it would end in\nimaginative fulfilment), but magnifies the existing desire, and joins\nit to the object in secret.\n*(1) The means being simpicity, he is comparitively free to make his\nown qualifications and difficulties, i.e., many retirements are absurd\nand at once prove his incapacity, the non existence of what he sets\nabout to prove. He at once sets his limit and servility.\n*(2) Just a natural desire.\n*(3) This is a short formula for those whose belief is full in the\nlaw, are house holders following their desires. The formula holds good\nfor any purpose.\n*(4) Illustration, the loss of faith in a friend, or an union that did\nnot fulfill expectations.\nCasting the Shadow.\nThe Ego not being totally oblivious, let him retain only and visualise\nthe Sigil form, it is his chalice, the means of vacuity and\nincarnation. By the deliberation of an analogous emotion at that time,\nhe deputises the law (reaction). Miraculous is he, balance not known\nin this world imitated (attained). All other consciousness annulled\nwith safety, the vehicle strong enough for the ecstasy, he is beyond\nhurt. Now let him imagine an union takes place between himself (the\nmystic union of the Ego and Absolute). The nectar emitted, let him\ndrink slowly, again and again*(1). After this astonishing experience\nhis passion is incomparable, there is nothing in the world he will\ndesire: unless he wills. That is why people do not understand me. The\necstasy in its emotion is omnigenous. Know it as the nectar of life,\nthe Syllubub of Sun and Moon. Verily he steals the fire from Heaven:\nthe greatest act of bravery in the world. Deliberation egotized,\nexcept in the refraction*(2) of the ecstasy, is exposure and death,\nbecoming a presiding obsession, control having been given to a prior\nexperience and is over-conscious of that through it momentarily\nfinding freedom from its native law; thus generating double\npersonality (Insanity).\n*(1) If it becomes physical, let him imagine another's body, he has\nthat sigil or its emergency. This, although not his original purpose,\nhe will and exceedingly amiable.\n*(2) Laughter in this case.\nBy these means there is no desire beyond fulfilment, no accomplishment\ntoo wonderful, depending on the amount of free belief*(3).\n*(3) It may be done by localizing desire to one sense, hence by this\nformula using the ear as the vehicle, one hears the most\ntranscendental music ever conceived, being the voices and harmony of\nevery conceivable animal and human existence and so with each sense.\nMen of small pleasure and enterprise, oblivious of your purpose,\nfault-finding, avaricious, sinful, who cannot live without women or\nenjoy without pain, fearsome, inconstant, diseased, and withered,\ndependent, cruel, deceived, and liars, the worst of men! Know, Oh,\nLord, Oh beloved Self, I have now told you of that most secret tavern\nwhere passion goes when youth has gone, where any man may drink of the\nnectar of all-beneficent and gratuitous ecstasy. The most pleasurable\nnourishment that harms no one.\nNOTE ON THE DIFFERENCE OF MAGICAL OBSESSION (GENIUS) AND INSANITY.\nMAGICAL obsession is that state when the mind is illuminated by\nsub-conscious activity evoked voluntarily by formula at our own time,\netc., for inspiration. It is the condition of Genius.\nOther obsession is the \"blind leading the blind,\" caused by quietism,\nknown as mediumism, an opening out of the Ego to (what is called) any\nexternal influence, elementals, or disembodied energy. A transmutated\nconsciousness that is a resistance to \"true\" sub-conscious activity,\nit being a voluntary insanity, a somnambulation of the Ego with \"no\nform\" or control to guide it: hence its emanations are stupid in\nsuggestion, or memories of childhood.\nObsession known as or related to insanity is an experience that is\ndissociated from the personality (Ego) through some sort of\nrejection. It is sub-crystalline, and cannot become permanently\nattached to the sub-consciousness, not having exhausted or completed\nitself by realisation. Depending on its degree of intensity and\nresistance shown at some time or another, the Ego has or has not\nknowledge of the obsession; always is its expression autonomous,\ndivorced from personal control, power of direction and\ntiming. Concentration determines dissociation. Enthusiasm for one\nobject seeking completion by identification, sacrifices all else, or\ndeliberately forgets. Its separation from the Ego (it becoming equal,\nor more in bulk than the rest of the consciousness, causes subdivision\nor \"double personality\"), is caused by its own intensity or by shock\nof resistance determined by some incompatibility of the desired or\ndesire.\nConcentration is dissatisfied desire, a conflict that can never be\nsatisfied, because of its means. When the Ego, not appearing to have\nor not knowing the means of fulfilment, seeks its repudiation,\nrepression, imaginative fulfilment, or transmutation to escape its\nworry. None of these is the desire's or obsession's annihilation, but\nits separation or concealment from the rest of the Ego, its premature\nsub-conscious existence. It is held there only when some form of\nresistance is active, when resistance is dormant- control is given to\nthe presiding obsession, allowing its incarnation in, and swamping of\nthe Ego, which has to live and perform its emotional\nexperience. Disease and Insanity (all disease is insanity) is caused\nwhen the disembodied energy has no vital function. It is this energy\nwhich is utilised for the vitalization of Sigils.\nSIGILS.\nThe Psychology of Believing.\nIf the \"supreme belief\" remains unknown, believing is fruitless. If\n\"the truth\" has not yet been ascertained, the study of knowledge is\nunproductive. Even if \"they\" were known their study is useless. We are\nnot the object by the perception, but by becoming it. Closing the\ngateways of sense is no help. Verily I will make common-sense the\nfoundation of my teaching. Otherwise, how can I convey my meaning to\nthe deaf, vision to the blind, and my emotion to the dead? In a\nlabyrinth of metaphor and words, intuition is lost, therefore without\ntheir effort must be learned the truth about one's self from him who\nalone knows the truth . . . . yourself.\nOf what use the wisdom of Virginity to him who has been raped by the\nseducer, ignorance? Of what use sciences or any knowledge except as\nmedicine? Hidden treasure does not come at the word nor by digging\nwith your hands in the main road. Even with the proper implements and\naccurate knowledge of place, etc., may be but the acquisition of what\nyou possessed long ago. There is a great doubt as to whether it is\nhidden, except by the strata of your experience and atmospheres of\nyour belief.\nThe pertinent question now proposed by \"Thee\" should be asked by those\ndesirous of some measure of genius. My answer like the mighty germ is\nin agreement with the universe, simple and full of deep import and for\na time extremely objectionable to your ideas of good and\nbeauty. Listen, attentively, O! Aspirant, all agog for information, to\nmy answer, for by living the meaning thou shalt truly be freed from\nthe bondage of constitutional ignorance. Thou must live it thyself; I\ncannot live it for thee.\nThe chief cause of genius is realization or \"I\" by an emotion that\nallows the lightning assimilation of what is perceived. This emotion\nis immoral in that it allows free association of knowledge without the\naccessories of belief. Its condition is, therefore, ignorance of \"I\nam\" and \"I am not\" with absent-mindedness as believing. Its most\nexcellent state is the \"Neither-Neither,\" the free or atmospheric \"I.\"\nYou remember in your youth the thought \"that this world is a curious\nplace\" in the emotion when you felt \"why\" as to whether this life is a\nreasonable development? What was the cause of this and of your\nsummarily dismissing it from your mind? Again the feeling that the\nmost commonplace object is magnificently strange and the vague emotion\nof co-relation between the incompatible (exhaustive arguments often\nsee this, but always excuse it); the curiosity and shock with a more\nintimate association with the wonders of creation. What is it that\nprevents you following investigation into \"what exactly is surprise,\"\netc.? What is the cause of your believing more in God than a\ndog-fight? Yet you fear dogs more than God! Where is the difference\nbetween yourself choked with disquieting piety, and the innocence of a\nbabe? Perhaps in these is the cause of ignorance.\nBelief is the fall from the Absolute. What are you going to believe?\nTruth seeks its own negation. Different aspects are not the truth, nor\nare they necessary to truth. Of its emanations which are you to\nstrangle at birth? Are you illegitimate? You believe in right and\nwrong- what punishment will you determine? Can you escape the driving\n\"Must\"? Who can escape boredom- without change? Who remain single and\ncontent! What man among you is large and free enough to encompass his\n\"self\"? Your belief obfuscates lineage. Ambition is smallness- your\ncustomed environment. Remember, time is an unstudied imagination of\nthe experienced. What may be called the early experience was its\ncompletion, so of learning there is no finis. What you learn to-morrow\nis determined by what you have done- the accomplished lesson of\nyesterday. Never learning to-day what you can do to-morrow is called\nloss, but is theft from time, wholesomeness and rejuvenescence. Repeat\nthis delay again and again till you arrive at spontaneity, chance in\nsafety. The pursuit of learning (believing) is the grotesque incubator\nof stupidity.\nIf you could truly believe, we should realise the virtue of it. We are\nnot free to believe . . . . however much we so desire, having\nconflicting ideas to first exhaust. Sigils are the art of believing;\nmy invention for making belief organic, ergo, true belief.\nWhen by the wish to believe- it is of the necessity incompatible with\nan existing belief and is not realized through the inhibition of the\norganic belief- the negation of the wish, faith moves no mountains,\nnot till it has removed itself. Supposing I wish to be great (is not\ncounting that I am), to have \"faith\" and believe that I am, does not\nmake me great- even were I to keep up the pretence to the end . . .\n. it being ceremonial insincerity, the affirmation of my\nincapacity. I am incapable, because that is the true belief, and\norganic. To believe differently is but affectation. Therefore the\nimagination or \"faith\" that I am great, is a superficial belief. The\nreaction and denial, caused by the troublesome effervescence of the\norganic incapacity. Denial or faith does not change or annihilate it,\nbut is its reinforcement and preservation. Therefore belief, to be\ntrue, must be organic and sub-conscious. The desire to be great can\nonly become organic at a time of vacuity, and by giving it (Sigil)\nform. When conscious of the Sigil form (any time but the Magical) it\nshould be repressed, a deliberate striving to forget it, by this it is\nactive and dominates at the unconscious period, its form nourishes and\nallows it to become attached to the sub-consciousness and become\norganic, that accomplished, is its reality and realization. He becomes\nhis concept of greatness.\nSo belief becomes true and vital by striving against it in\nconsciousness and by giving it form. Not by the striving of\nfaith. Belief exhausts itself by confession and non-resistance, i.e.,\nconsciousness. Believe not to believe, and in degree you will obtain\nits existence. Timeliness depending on your morality, give to the\npoor. If the ambitious only knew it is as difficult to become\nincapable as it is to become great. They are mutual as accomplishments\nand equally satisfying.\nTHE SUB-CONSCIOUSNESS.\nALL geniuses have active sub-consciousness, and the less they are\naware of the fact, the greater their accomplishments. The\nsub-consciousness is exploited by desire reaching it. So consciousness\nshould not contain the \"great\" desire once the Ego has wished: and\nshould be filled with an affected ambition for something different,\nnot vice-versa, the inevitable penalty of cowardice lurking somewhere:\nsurely not an inglorious deceit? Genius, like heroism, is a matter of\nbravery- you have to forget fear, or incapacity somehow . . . .\nhence its expression is always spontaneous. How simple it is to\nacquire genius- you know the means; who will take the plunge? The\nlearning of \"How\" is the eternal \"Why\"- unanswered! A genius is such,\nbecause he does not know how or why.\nThe Storehouse of Memories with an Ever-Open Door.\nKnow the sub-consciousness to be an epitome of all experience and\nwisdom, past incarnations as men, animals, birds, vegetable life,\netc., etc., everything that exists, has and ever will exist. Each\nbeing a stratum in the order of evolution. Naturally then, the lower\nwe probe into these strata, the earlier will be the forms of life we\narrive at; the last is the Almighty Simplicity. And if we succeed in\nawakening them, we shall gain their properties, and our accomplishment\nwill correspond. They being experiences long passed, must be evoked by\nextremely vague suggestion, which can only operate when the mind is\nunusually quiet or simple. To have their wisdom does not mean the\nnecessity of their bodies- the body modifies in relation to \"means\"\n(we travel faster than the hunting leopard, but do not have its body),\nwhen it is the means it changes accordingly. Now, if we observe\nNature, the early forms of life are wonderful in their properties,\nadaptablility, etc; their strength enormous, and some are\nindestructible. No matter what the desire is, it always is its\naccomplishment. A microbe has the power to destroy the world (and\ncertainly would if it took an interest in us). If you were to\ndismember its limb, the mutilated part would regrow, etc. So by\nevoking and becoming obsessed or illuminated by these existences, we\ngain their magical properties, or the knowledge of their\nattainment. This is what already happens (everything happens at all\ntimes) though exceedingly slowly; in striving for knowledge we repel\nit, the mind works best on a simple diet.\nThe Key to Prophecy.\nThe law of Evolution is retrogression of function governing\nprogression of attainment, i.e., the more wonderful our attainments,\nthe lower in the scale of life that governs them. Our knowledge of\nflight is determined by that desire causing the activity of our bird\netc. Karmas. Directly our desire reaches the stratum belonginging to\nthose existences that can \"fly\" without wings- so shall we fly without\nmachines. This sub-conscious activity is the \"capacity,\" the\n\"knowledge\"; all other we acquire is of a negative or manurial\nvalue. The virtue of learning and acquiring knowledge by the ordinary\nmeans is in its worry and disappointment, of that degree which causes\nexhaustion: by that the desire might accidentally reach the real abode\nof knowledge, i.e., the sub-consciousness. Inspiration is always at a\nvoid moment, and most great discoveries accidental, usually brought\nabout by exhaustion of the mind. My formula and Sigils for\nsub-conscious activity are the means of inspiration, capacity or\ngenius, and the means of accelerating evolution. An economy of energy\nand method of learning by enjoyment. A bat first grew wings and of the\nproper kind, by its desire being organic enough to reach the\nsub-consciousness. If its desire to fly had been conscious, it would\nhave had to wait till it could have done so by the same means as\nourselves, i.e., by machinery. All genius has an hypothesis (usually\nnatural) in the form of a hobby, which serves to restrain and occupy\nthe conscious mind, to prevent its interference with spontaneous\nexpression. The great Leonardo's mathematics, etc., served to\n\"Deceive\" him as such an hypothesis (and as Sigils). Our lives are\nfull of the Symbolism of those predominating Karmas we are governed\nby. All ornament, useless dress, etc., are such (they please people\nbecause they feel the identification), and the means of locating them\n(Karmas). The symbolism of crowning a man King, is that he, resembling\nGod (on earth), has reached the lowest strata of his sub-consciousness\n(those one-cell organisms if you like), which predominate as governing\nhis functions. (Of course, those crowned Kings are never such, they\nsymbolise the \"hope,\" not the reality.) Hence the floral nature of and\nprecious stones in design of the crown relate to first principles. He\nis King who has reached the dual principle in its simplicity, the\nfirst experience which is all experience . . . . he has no need of\ncrowns and kingdoms.\nBy Sigils and the acquirement of vacuity, any past incarnation,\nexperience, etc., can be summoned to consciousness. It may even happen\nin sleep in the form of dreams, but this means is very\ndifficult. (Chapters on day and night dreaming for pleasure omitted.)\nTotal vacuity is difficult and unsafe for those governed by morality,\ncomplexes, i.e., whose belief is not entirely self-love. Hence this\ndesideratum of Sigils, etc.\nKnow all ritual, ceremony, conditions, as arbitrary (you have yourself\nto please), a hindrance and confusion; their origin was for amusement,\nlater for the purpose of deceiving other from knowing the truth and\ninducing ignorance; and as always happens their high priests were the\nmore deceived themselves. He who deceives another deceives himself\nmuch more. Therefore know the Charlatans by their love of rich robes,\nceremony, ritual, magical retirements, absurd conditions, and other\nstupidity, too numerous to relate. Their entire doctrine a boastful\ndisplay, a cowardice hungering for notoriety; their standard\neverything unnecessary, their certain failure assured. Hence it is\nthat those with some natural ability quickly lose it by their\nteaching. They can only dogmatise, implant and multiply that which is\nentirely superficial. Were I a teacher I should not act as master, as\nknowing more, the pupil could lay no claim to\ndiscipleship. Assimilating slowly, he would not be conscious of his\nlearning, he would not repeat the vital mistake; without fear he would\naccomplish with ease. The only teaching possible is to show a man how\nto learn from his own wisdom, and to utilise his ignorance and\nmistakes. Not by obscuring his vision and intention by righteousness.\nSIGILS. BELIEF WITH PROTECTION.\nMagickal Obsession.\nI will now explain their creation and use; there is no difficulty\nabout it, how pure and clear it all is*(1). Out of love for my foolish\ndevotees I invented it. All desire, whether for Pleasure, Knowledge,\nor Power, that cannot find \"Natural\" expression, can by Sigils and\ntheir formula find fulfilment from the sub-consciousness. Sigils are\nthe means of guiding and uniting the partially free belief*(2) with an\norganic desire, its carriage and retention till its purpose served in\nthe sub-conscious self, and its means of reincarnation in the Ego. All\nthought can be expressed by form in true relation. Sigils are\nmonograms of thought, for the government of energy (all heraldry,\ncrests, monograms, are Sigils and the Karmas they govern), relating to\nKarma; a mathematical means of symbolising desire and giving it form\nthat has the virtue of preventing any thought and association on that\nparticular desire (at the magical time), escaping the detection of the\nEgo, so that it does not restrain or attach such desire to its own\ntransitory images, memories and worries, but allows it free passage to\nthe sub-consciousness.\n*(1) By this system, you know exactly what (you believe) your Sigil\nmust relate to. If you used any form stupidly, you might possibly\n\"conjure up\" exactly what you did not want- the mother of insanity, or\nwhat always happens then, nothing at all. This being the only system,\nany result other than by it is accidental. Also you do not have to\ndress up as a traditional magician, wizard or priest, build expensive\ntemples, obtain virgin parchment, black goat's blood, etc., etc., in\nfact no theatricals or humbug.\n*(2) Free belief or energy, i.e., a disappointed desire, not yet an\nobsession.\nSigils are made by combining the letters of the alphabet\nsimplified. Illustration*(3), the word \"Woman\" in Sigil form is\n(example) or (example) or (example) etc. The word tiger (example) or\n(example) etc., etc. The idea being to obtain a simple form which can\nbe easily visualised at will, and has not too much pictorial relation\nto the desire. The true method has a much greater virtue, which cannot\nbe explained briefly, being the secret of thought form, as degrees of\nsuggestion, and what exactly is in a name. We have now agreed as to\nhow a Sigil is made, and what virtue it has. Verily, what a person\nbelieves by Sigils, is the truth, and is always fulfilled. This system\nof Sigils is believed by taking it up as a hobby at a time of great\ndisappointment or sorrow. By Sigils I have endowed fools with wisdom,\nmade the wise fools, giving health to the sick and weak, disease to\nthe strong, etc. Now, if for some purpose, you wanted the strength of\na tiger- you would make a sentence such as:- \"This my wish to obtain\nthe strength of a tiger.\" (Message from person who typed up this file:\nIn constructing the sentence of desire, beginning with \"This my will,\"\nhas been said by some to be more efficacious.) Sigilized this would\nbe:-\nThis my wish (illustrative example of this part of the sentence)\nTo obtain (ditto)\nThe strength of a Tiger (same as said above)\nCombined as one Sigil (example) or (more simplified example).\n*(3) There are six methods of Sigils employed in this book, each\ncorresponding to different strata. The one shown here is illustrative\nand the fundamental idea of them all, from which anyone can evolve his\nown system. Conditions, etc., or necessity subsequently evolve\nthemselves. Also a person has more power of creation and originality\nwith a limited means of expression.\nNow by virtue of this Sigil you are able to send your desire into the\nsubconsciousness (which contains all strength); that having happened,\nit is the desire's realization by the manifestation of the knowledge\nor power necessary.\nFirst, all consciousness except of the Sigil has to be annulled; do\nnot confuse this with concentration- you simply conceive the Sigil any\nmoment you begin to think. Vacuity* is obtained by exhausting the mind\nand body by some means or another. A personal or traditional means\nserves equally well, depending on temperament; choose the most\npleasant; these should be held in favour, Mantras and Posture, Women\nand Wine, Tennis, and the playing of Patience, or by walking and\nconcentration on the Sigil, etc., etc. None is necessary to him who\nhas (even symbolically) for a moment by the \"Neither-Neither\"\nconquered the dual principle (Conception), his Ego is free from\ngravity. If the Sigil is made an obsession by continual apprehension,\nits realization may happen at any moment, in the form of\ninspiration. This is done by reverting the mind to the Sigil when one\nis extremely worried- the time of exhaustion is the time of\nfulfilment. At the time of exhaustion or vacuity, retain only and\nvisualize the Sigil form- eventually it becomes vague, then vanishes\nand success is assured. by the Ego conceiving only the Sigil, and not\nbeing able to conceive anything from it, all energy is focussed\nthrough it, the desire for identification carries it to the\ncorresponding sub-conscious stratum, its destination. The Sigil being\na vehicle, serves the purpose of protecting consciousness from the\ndirect manifestation of the (consciously unacknowledged) obsession,\nconflict is avoided with any incompatible ideas and neither gains\nseparate personality. It (the obsession) is either gradually\nassimilated and becomes organic or returns to its original abode, its\npurpose of illumination served. Hence the mind, by Sigils, depending\nupon the intensity of desire, is illuminated or obsessed (knowledge or\npower) from that particular Karma (the sub-conscious stratum, a\nparticular existence and knowledge gained by it) relative to the\ndesire, but not from memory or experience which was recent. Knowledge\nis obtained by the sensation, resulting from the unity of the desire\nand Karma. Power, by its \"actual\" vitalization and resurrection.\n* This is not the passivity of mediumism which opens the mind to what\nis called external influence- disembodied energy usually having no\nbetter purpose than to rap-tables. There are many means of attaining\nthis state of vacuity: I mention the most simple, there is no need for\ncrucifixion. Drugs are useless. Smoking and laziness the more\ndifficult.\nThis knowledge leaves its stratum in company with the energy or desire\nreturning to the Ego. It escapes the Ego's resistance by associating\nwith similar images, memories, or experiences relative (recieved in\nthis life), that the mind contains, and crystalizes itself by their\nsymbolism. Hence most illumination is symbolic, and must be\nsubsequently translated.\n(Chapters on Symbolism, Automatic Drawing As Means To Art, & Note on\nSacred Letters omitted.)\nON MYSELF.\nConceiving, thou hast given no sign of life. In claiming thee, a\nlabour of creating value, is nothing worth holding, nothing\nsatisfying; the realization of thy inhibition all? By self-effacement\nwould seem reality. This self, how empty! how prolific of\nincompleteness! In self-denial its stimulation to simulate reality .\n. . . more and more comes out- these ugly mists of illusion are\nparental, the cause of Heaven's hatred! That is why I fear to believe\nin God, subordination to an attribute, an idea of Self is not freedom\nof love! Probably Almighty is he who is unconscious of the idea of\nGod. Now may the fierceness of my unity be \"Thy\" silence and for me no\nlonger a query or labour to espouse my doubt. Yet mankind for ever\ndoubts, quirks, and for every pleasure pays, till he becomes\nmillionary: the punishment shall fit the appraisement of his\ncapitalization, there is that fear! The rich in dross, to cheat his\nconscience, affects humility, speaks of himself as \"poor,\" his\npossessions as \"burdens,\" or of \"small account\"! Of what consolation\nthe truth in the day of weary waiting and watching, the restless\nstriving, the imprisonment, the rack, the horrors of every conceivable\ntorture? When he becomes accustomed, loses reality, and no longer\ndeterred, will he then create God and miseries afresh? Oh, folly of\nthe world, deny thy faith, renounce this Bloody-Sceptred God and\nconfess. The completion of folly is the beginning of childhood, but of\nknowledge there is no end. It was the straying that found the path\ndirect. From childhood, I have never denied my invincible purpose. Oh,\nsilent watcher, thou sleepless eye of the Universe, watch over the\nbeginning of all my ideas.

{"text": "Determination of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of methanol extracts obtained from the fruit and leaves of Tunisian Lycium intricatum Boiss.\nA comparative analysis of methanol extracts from fruit and leaves of Lycium intricatum Boiss., a Solanaceous shrubbery with the potential to become a high-value crop, was performed by means of liquid chromatography with photodiode array and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric detection (LC/PDA/ESI-MS). The total phenolic (TPC), anthocyanin (TAC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents as well as the antioxidant capacity measured by four complementary methods were performed for each sample. The results showed the tested extracts to be rich sources of phenolics; in leaves polyphenols and flavonoids dominate, while in fruit anthocyanins dominate. Nineteen phenolic compounds were detected and fifteen were identified or tentatively characterised based on Photodiode-array ultraviolet visible (PDA) UV-Vis spectra, ESI-MS spectrometric data and spiking experiments with authentic standards. Rutin and chlorogenic acid are the major constituents of the leaves and fruit, respectively. Results obtained in this study have revealed that leaves exhibit better performance in all antioxidant assays. From these results it has been shown that extracts of L. intricatum have great potential as a source of phenolics for natural health products.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Public Statements\n\nGov. Roemer Reacts to Negligence of Not-So-Supercommittee\n\nPress Release\n\nGovernor Buddy Roemer, former four-term member of Congress and Governor of Louisiana, today announced an Open Letter to the United States House of Representatives. The letter chastises Congress for the failure of the so-called \"Supercommittee\" to arrive at a resolution for reaching $1.2 trillion dollars in spending cuts prior to the Thanksgiving break. The letter also goes on to offer concrete recommendations, drawing on Roemer's extensive public service experience, for improving America's economy, finding necessary cuts, and balancing trade with China.\n\nSpecifically, Governor Roemer proposes a simple four point plan for controlling federal spending, if only Congress would summon the political will to do so. While other Presidential candidates have criticized the failure of the Supercommittee, none have offered solutions as detailed and specific as Governor Roemer's.\n\nThe plan tells Congress to first \"Abandon the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction,\" arguing plausibly that the committee is just not doing its job. Next, Congress should conduct an up or down vote on the recommendations of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. This could potentially reduce our deficit by $4 trillion dollars, far more than the not-so-supercommittee was unable to achieve. Congress should also reinstate a version of Glass-Steagall, which separated investment banks from commercial banks and mitigated some of the risk that led to the banking collapse of 2007. Finally, Congress should enact laws that level the playing field with China and contain disincentives for the Communist Chinese government to engage in currency manipulation, such as the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act.\n\nThese proposals, taken together, amount to an ambitious plan that Congress should implement, but first they need to return to work. Calling it \"quits\" three days before Thanksgiving is negligent behavior.\n\nIn his closing words to Congress, Governor Buddy Roemer is not afraid to call them out on their desire to be re-elected at all costs. On this issue, Governor Roemer leads by example. He was the only member of Congress never to accept PAC or special interest money, and he continues to refuse his benefits as a former member of Congress. Roemer then tells the Congress, \"I promise you, if you make the right choice, the money won't matter. You'll get reelected for what you did for the American people, not what you did for the corporations.\"\n\nGovernor Buddy Roemer is a four-term Congressman and former Governor of Louisiana. He is known for refusing PAC and special interest money, implementing campaign finance reform, turning around Louisiana's failing economy and cutting the State's employment rate in half in just four years. Roemer is a candidate for President of the United States. His website is www.BuddyRoemer.com.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Meta-analysis for the comparison of two diagnostic tests to a common gold standard: A generalized linear mixed model approach.\nMeta-analysis of diagnostic studies is still a rapidly developing area of biostatistical research. Especially, there is an increasing interest in methods to compare different diagnostic tests to a common gold standard. Restricting to the case of two diagnostic tests, in these meta-analyses the parameters of interest are the differences of sensitivities and specificities (with their corresponding confidence intervals) between the two diagnostic tests while accounting for the various associations across single studies and between the two tests. We propose statistical models with a quadrivariate response (where sensitivity of test 1, specificity of test 1, sensitivity of test 2, and specificity of test 2 are the four responses) as a sensible approach to this task. Using a quadrivariate generalized linear mixed model naturally generalizes the common standard bivariate model of meta-analysis for a single diagnostic test. If information on several thresholds of the tests is available, the quadrivariate model can be further generalized to yield a comparison of full receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

{"text": "Since the days of Nintendo’s Wii, there has been a promise of video games being able to replicate the actual movement of sports. Wii Sports had a variety of games, but it turned out the motion controls were largely simple, much like the cartoony art of the games included.\n\nWhen such a sports game comes out for VR it is on this spectrum too. Are the controls detailed and realistic to bring an outdoor game inside our homes with all the nuance intact? Or are the movements simplified, the results exaggerated?\n\nWhen I tried Everybody’s Golf VR for PlayStation VR at a preview event last week, it felt like a game that was trying to carefully drive straight down the middle.\n\nYou stand at the Tee with a single Move controller, held downward to mimic a golf club. You swing a few times, getting a feel for the force you need to swing with. The game tracks the speed at which you swing, tracking the force with a horizontal bar that is labelled 0 to 100%. The game has conveniently given you the appropriate club, turned you to face in the correct direction, and puts a flag icon on that horizontal bar showing the ideal amount of force needed — at the start of a hole it is likely the full 100%. As you near the green, it may be more like 83% or 46%.\n\nAnd you swing a few times for practice, seeing the bar fill up towards your target percentage, and the color of the afterimage of the club head helpfully showing red if you are too high and blue if you are low enough to hit the ball. You press the Move’s center button to abandon the Practice mode.\n\nAnd you swing. And the ball flies off. You can’t really see the ball in the distance as it travels, so you watch the numbers of yards count up toward your goal.\n\nAnd you repeat. Sometimes your swings miss, even though it seems like it should’ve hit the ball. The game just won’t register it as a hit if you don’t have enough velocity. Fortunately, the game doesn’t count these swings against your score for that hole.\n\nHow finicky the swing detection is makes things especially tricky once you get to the green, when I had a few putts where I needed to get a 2% bar to get in the hole. A few swings with increasingly exaggerated force and finally it registered, with the ball overshooting with 8%. But it still went in the hole with a “Chip-In.” I’m still not sure it was the game’s tolerances or the tracking which had those swings failing.\n\nThe game’s focus on somewhat realistic control with moderate assistance to simplify golf’s movements is in full evidence at the green. The hole has a visible vortex to suck in the ball — ala the above 8% percent putt — though you can turn it off for a more realistic putting game. The green also has a simple grid overlay to help show the geometry of the green, any dips down or slopes up. But the grid lines are so spaced apart, perhaps at approximately 5 yards, that it isn’t terribly useful.\n\nThe demo had only 2 holes, which I played through twice, as I finally got a decent swing going and sunk a Birdie. This was on a Forest level, which had vibrant trees and cherry blossoms in the distance. It is the first of three 18-hole courses planned. The second is Seaside, which I did not see, and a third, which is unrevealed.\n\nThe game’s graphics were of that VR style I call “simple/sharp.” There’s not a lot of objects or geometry, but what is there has detailed textures that engross you enough. Green and intricate grass, leaves, and trees. A female caddy, one of many you can choose from, stands there and occasionally gives you advice about the fairway or putting green, but mostly is there for some added graphical realism beyond the landscape.\n\nThe company hasn’t revealed what leaderboard/highscore functionality or online multiplayer options will be coming when the game is released, though I was told there will be no local multiplayer. Players will have to swing the clubs by themselves, though accompanied by all the graphical overlays.\n\nSo this VR version of Golf doesn’t hit that exaggerated, bold art and feel of something like Wii Golf. Nor is it the detailed simulation of the game seen in the past, with dozens of clubs to choose from when you perform nuanced swings that provide English to the ball. It seems to be a simple, and enjoyable test of your ability to swing just hard enough. Which may entertain your lay fan of Golf video games.\n\nEverybody’s Golf VR will be released May 21 for $29.99.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

However, the specific association is still controversial. We examined whether DRD2 Ser311Cys polymorphism confers schizophrenia risk in Asian populations. Sixteen studies were retrieved reporting on a total of 2268 schizophrenia patients and 2423 healthy controls. Meta-analysis of the results showed significant associations between Ser311Cys polymorphism and schizophrenia risk in the comparisons of G versus C (odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.83, P = 0.0006) and CG+GG versus CC (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.16- 1.82, P = 0.001). In a subgroup analysis by nationality, we found a significant association between Ser311Cys polymorphism and schizophrenia risk in the comparisons of G versus C and CG+GG versus CC genotype in the Japanese population (OR = 1.75, 95%CI = 1.30-2.35, P = 0.0002; OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.27-2.33, P = 0.0004; respectively) but not in Chinese and Indian populations.

{"text": "Abbreviations\n=============\n\nH1Histamine receptor 1H2Histamine receptor 2H4Histamine receptor 4MDSCsmyeloid-derived suppressor cellsTAMstumor-associated macrophages\n\nIntroduction {#s0001}\n============\n\nSelective H2 antagonists such as ranitidine and famotidine are some of the most frequently used drugs for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal disorders. In recent years, these drugs have frequently been replaced by proton pump inhibitors[@cit0001] due to their improved potency and in view of anecdotal reports of myelo-suppressive actions of H2 antagonists.[@cit0003] However, there remains a large population of people, with and without cancer, that regularly take H2 antagonists. Information on how these drugs impact cancer immunity is limited.\n\nH2 expression has been reported on several tumor cell types[@cit0005] including some types of breast cancer (reviewed in ref. [@cit0008]). Other cells within the tumor microenvironment can also express H2, including immune effector cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.[@cit0009] H2 signaling has been shown to both enhance[@cit0011] and inhibit tumor cell growth *in vitro*.[@cit0005] H2 antagonists have been reported to be effective in the treatment of certain cancer types, specifically H2-expressing colorectal cancers [@cit0013], reviewed in ref. [@cit0015]) although the mechanism of these responses remains unclear.\n\nAntitumor immune responses, including tumor immune surveillance, are complex and involve both innate and acquired components. Effective host immune function can reduce the incidence of tumors, limiting their growth and subsequent metastasis. NK cells and CD8^+^ T cells are recognized as critical effector cells in antitumor immunity and tumor surveillance. Monocytes and macrophage subsets are pivotal in local immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages and a population of cells known as MDSCs that includes both immature neutrophilic and monocytic subsets, have been shown to reduce effective antitumor immune function by inhibiting T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic macrophages,[@cit0016] and inducing T regulatory cell development.[@cit0023] MDSCs have been found to be a barrier in inducing cancer immunity with immunotherapy, and combination treatments that include drugs such as gemcitabine are used to decrease MDSC levels.[@cit0024] In mice, MDSCs can be identified, in part, by the expression of surface markers CD11b, Ly6C and Ly6G, which denote their monocyte and neutrophil lineage.[@cit0028]\n\nHistamine can modulate multiple immune effector cells via H2. It has been implicated in enhanced mobilization of dendritic cells, and decreased IL-12 secretion,[@cit0029] which can then alter subsequent antibody generation, and NK and T cell activity. H2 receptors can also modulate the cytolytic activity of NK cells,[@cit0033] inhibit both Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion[@cit0035] and enhance IL-10 secretion.[@cit0036] Conversely, H2 blockade on T cells alleviates suppression of IFNγ secretion[@cit0029] and inhibits IL-10 production.[@cit0036] H2 signaling on monocytes can block expression of adhesion molecules involved in T cell activation, such as ICAM-1 and CD40. Therefore, in the context of an H2 antagonist, enhanced T cell proliferation and IFNγ secretion can ensue.[@cit0031] H2 blockade can also alter the cytolytic activity of NK and CD8^+^ cells, in general reducing NK activity[@cit0033] and enhancing CD8^+^ activity.[@cit0038] Despite these findings, the role of H2 antagonists as regulators of effective immune responses to breast cancer has not been systematically examined.\n\nThere are a few studies looking at the impact of histamine on MDSCs. MDSCs express H1 and H2 and immature myeloid cells express histidine decarboxylase (HDC) which is important for MDSC development. HDC expression by myeloid cells was shown to impact tumor growth in a colon cancer model.[@cit0039] Histamine from mast cells can also modify MDSC activity and symptomatic allergic patients have increased MDSC function although the impact of H2 receptors antagonists was not directly addressed.[@cit0039] A study using cimetidine which has both H2 antagonist and a number of off target effects showed evidence of cimetidine-induced MDSC apoptosis. However, the more selective H2 antagonist famotidine did not have similar effects.[@cit0040]\n\nIn the current study, the ability of the widely used selective H2 antagonist ranitidine to modify key myeloid populations in the context of breast tumors was determined. Breast tumor development and metastasis was also studied in three distinct mouse models that highlight different stages of tumor development and spread. Our results demonstrate that ranitidine reduces select populations of monocytic cells consistent with an impact on MDSC, and inhibits initial tumor development, primary tumor growth and metastasis to the lung in breast cancer models.\n\nResults {#s0002}\n=======\n\nRanitidine treatment reduces CD11b^+^Ly6C^hi^ cells in the spleen and the bone marrow in both naive and tumor-bearing mice {#s0002-0001}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe H2 antagonist ranitidine was orally administered to groups of BALB/c mice at a dose of 8 mg/kg for 8 d and the impact of treatment on splenic and bone marrow myeloid cell populations was determined. Myeloid cells can be identified, in part, by the expression of surface markers CD11b, Ly6C and Ly6G, which denote their monocyte (CD11b^+^Ly6C^hi^) and neutrophil (CD11b^+^Ly6G^+^Ly6C^lo^) lineage. Ranitidine treatment was associated with an increased percentage of Ly6G^+^Ly6C^lo^ cells and decreased percentage of Ly6C^hi^ cells within CD11b^+^ splenocytes. This was reflected by a decreased frequency of CD11b^+^Ly6C^hi^ splenocytes ([Fig. 1A](#f0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Total splenocyte numbers were unaltered by ranitidine treatment (7.2 × 10^7^ ± 8.8 × 10^6^, n = 15 vs. 6.4×10^7^ ± 7.5 × 10^6^, n = 12 cells in control and ranitidine-treated, respectively). Bone marrow cells from ranitidine-treated mice also showed a decreased percentage of Ly6C^hi^ cells within the CD11b^+^ cells and a decreased frequency of CD11b^+^Ly6C^hi^ cells ([Fig. 1B](#f0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Total bone marrow cellularity was not significantly decreased in ranitidine-treated animals (5.5 × 10^7^ ± 4.0 × 10^6^, n = 12 vs. 5.1 × 10^7^ ± 3.6 × 10^6^, n = 12 cells in control and ranitidine-treated, respectively).

[@cit0028]), therefore the effect of ranitidine on the splenocyte populations in mice bearing 4T1 breast tumors, associated with modulation of MDSC's,[@cit0042] was examined. Mice were treated with ranitidine or left untreated for 8 d in the context of breast tumor development. Similar to what was observed in naive mice, there was an increase in the proportion of CD11b^+^Ly6G^+^Ly6C^lo^ cells following ranitidine treatment ([Fig. 2](#f0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and a decrease in CD11b^+^ Ly6C^hi^ monocytic cells in the spleen. There was an overall decrease in the numbers of myeloid cells by approximately 40% in the spleen, which could be attributed to a decrease in monocytes with ranitidine treatment. There was no overall change in lymphoid cell popu-lations. Figure 2.Ranitidine treatment decreases CD11b^+^Ly6C^hi^ population in the spleen of 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice.

Ranitidine and other selected histamine receptor antagonists, including cetirizine (H1), JNJ7-777120 (H4), cimetidine and pyrilamine (H1 and H2) and famotidine, an alternate H2 antagonist, were examined. None of the drugs showed a significant effect on 4T1 primary tumor endpoint weight (Table S1) or in the growth kinetics of the tumor over 19--21 d (Fig. S1). However, ranitidine had a significant impact on lung tumor metastasis with a mean percent inhibition of 61% compared with control-treated mice ([Fig. 3A](#f0003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Animals given oral famotidine also showed a significant decrease (mean percent inhibition of 58%) in lung metastasis. Pyrilamine showed a trend toward metastasis inhibition (mean percent inhibition of 34%) while cetirizine and JNJ7777120 showed no effect on metastasis. The anti-metastatic effect of ranitidine was dose dependent, with the greatest inhibition at an oral dose of 8 mg/kg. Lung tumor burden was similar to control 4T1 tumor bearing mice when a dose of 0.125 mg/kg of ranitidine was administered ([Fig. 3B](#f0003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Figure 3.Histamine receptor antagonists inhibit 4T1 metastasis. (A) Average number of 4T1 colonies derived from lungs of tumor-bearing BALB/c mice treated with ranitidine (8 mg/kg), famotidine (□ 8mg/kg and ⊠ 2mg/kg), pyrilamine (10 mg/kg), and cetirizine (10 mg/kg). (B) Number of 4T1 colonies derived from lungs of tumor-bearing mice treated with decreasing doses of ranitidine. Data points in (A) represent mean of 3--4 mice per group per experiment; data in (B) represent mean ± SEM of 3--42 mice. *p* \\< 0.05, *p* \\< 0.01, paired t-test (A), ANOVA followed by a Dunnett\\'s test (B).\n\nEvaluation of potential direct effects of histamine receptor antagonists on tumor growth {#s0002-0003}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome breast cancer cells as well as normal breast tissue can express H2 receptors[@cit0043] (for a review see ref. [@cit0008]). Neither H1 nor H2 receptor antagonists had a direct effect on 4T1 cell proliferation or ability to migrate *in vitro* (Fig. S2). E0771 cells were similarly unaffected by histamine receptor antagonist treatment *in vitro* (data not shown). In keeping with these findings, neither 4T1 cells nor E0771 cells expressed H1 or H2 receptors (Fig. S3). These findings confirmed that H2 antagonists are not directly affecting the tumor cells via H2 receptors.\n\nCD8^+^ T cells are not essential for ranitidine effects on metastasis {#s0002-0004}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious studies have shown that histamine can inhibit CD8^+^ T cell activation through a decrease in IL-12 production[@cit0029] and an increase in IL-10,[@cit0036] which would lead to a decrease in Th1 cells and IFNγ secretion. Therefore, tumor growth and metastasis in the presence or absence of ranitidine following antibody mediated CD8^+^ T cell depletion within recipient mice was compared. As in fully immunocompetent mice, there was no alteration in final tumor weight and tumor growth kinetics when mice were treated with ranitidine ([Fig. 4A](#f0004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, there was still a decrease in lung tumor metastasis following ranitidine treatment, even in the absence of CD8^+^ T cells, with a mean percent inhibition of 57% (three experiments, four mice/group) between control and ranitidine-treated CD8-depleted mice (compared to 61% mean percentage inhibition between control and ranitidine-treated mice without CD8 depletion, [Fig. 4B](#f0004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Therefore, CD8^+^ T cells are not essential for the ranitidine-induced inhibition of metastasis in the 4T1 model. Figure 4.Ranitidine does not affect lung metastases by directly affecting CD8^+^ activity. (A) Final tumor weight of ranitidine treated mice with and without CD8^+^ depletion. (B) Number of 4T1 cell colonies that developed from lungs of tumor bearing BALB/c mice treated with ranitidine with and without CD8^+^ depletion. Data from (A) represent average of individual mice and line represents mean per group. Data in (B) represents mean ± SEM of 6--12 mice per group.\n\nMice treated with ranitidine demonstrate decreased suppression of T cell function compared with control animals {#s0002-0005}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn view of the observed changes in myeloid cells bearing the markers associated with MDSCs, the ability of circulating cells from ranitidine-treated mice to modify T cell proliferation was examined. In view of our results which suggested CD8^+^ T cells are not responsible for the effect ranitidine has on metastasis, the effect of potential MDSCs were analyzed on CD4^+^ T cell proliferation. Leukocytes derived from ranitidine-treated mice were significantly less able to suppress the CD4^+^ T cell proliferation in response to antigen (*p* \\< 0.05) when compared with cells from control mice, with the level of proliferation increasing from 32% to 43% ([Fig. 5](#f0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). L-NMMA and nor-NOHA were used, at doses shown to be effective in similar systems, to inhibit NOS2 and Arg1.[@cit0044] However, neither inhibitor alone was able to significantly reduce the inhibitory activity of MDSCs. There was a trend toward decreased suppressive activity with simultaneous inhibition of NOS2 and Arg1 in animals that did not receive ranitidine treatment (mean 13.4% increase in proliferation, with 5/7 mice showing evidence of inhibited MDSC function) which was not observed in the ranitidine treated group that had been shown to have reduced MDSC function (mean 1.6% decrease in proliferation) following NOS2 and Arg1 blockade (n = 7, data not shown). Our results suggest that although there was altered functional activity of MDSCs from mice treated with ranitidine, the main mechanism of suppression of CD4^+^ T cell responses in this model was not dependent on NOS2 or Arg1. Figure 5.Peripheral blood leukocytes from ranitidine-treated tumor-bearing mice have decreased suppressive functions. Peripheral blood leukocytes from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with and without treatment were isolated and plated with Oregon Green-labeled D011.10 splenocytes with ova^323-339^. After 3 d incubation, proliferation was measured. Data points in (A) represents mean ± SEM of 9 mice. (B) Representative data of one mouse/treatment. Gray histogram represent unstimulated Oregon Green^+^CD4^+^ cells. *p* \\< 0.05, *p* \\< 0.01, unpaired t-test.\n\nRanitidine decreases primary tumor growth in a second orthotopic model {#s0002-0006}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo examine whether the effect of ranitidine was specific to the 4T1 model, a similar experiment using the less metastatic E0771 mouse model of breast cancer in C57BL/6 was performed. Initially, similar tumor growth kinetics was observed with and without ranitidine treatment. However, a decrease in tumor growth occurred in ranitidine-treated animals starting at approximately day 13 post tumor cell injection ([Fig. 6A](#f0006){ref-type=\"fig\"}). A similar regression was not observed in animals that received control drinking water. At the time of tumor harvest, a significantly decreased final tumor weight was observed in animals that had received ranitidine treatment compared to the control animals ([Fig. 6B](#f0006){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This simpler, short-term model was employed for additional studies of the mechanism of ranitidine-dependent tumor inhibition. The impact of omeprazole treatment on tumor growth was examined to control for any impact of reduced stomach acid on microbiome or related immune responses. Omeprazole treatment did not alter E0771 tumor growth when compared to control mice ([Fig. 7](#f0007){ref-type=\"fig\"}). No significant metastasis to the lung was observed in this model within the experimental time frame. Figure 6.Ranitidine treatment decreases E0771-GFP tumor growth. (A) E0771 tumors in C57BL/6 mice treated with ranitidine (8 mg/kg) were measured every 2 d starting 7 d post E0771-GFP cell injection. (B) At day 21, the primary tumor was excised and weighed. Data in (A) represents the mean ± SEM tumor volume of 11--12 mice/point. Data points in (B) represent final tumor weight of individual mice. *p* \\< 0.05, unpaired t-test. Figure 7.Omeprazole treatment does not alter E0771-GFP tumor development. (A) E0771 tumors in C57BL/6 mice treated with omeprazole (1.275 mg/d in mash) were measured every 2 d starting 7 d post E0771-GFP cell injection. (B) At day 20, the primary tumor was excised and weighed. Data in (A) represents the mean ± SEM tumor volume of 10 mice/point. Data points in (B) represent final tumor weight of individual mice.\n\nRanitidine does not alter E0771 development if monocytes are depleted by gemcitabine treatment {#s0002-0007}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo determine whether the effect ranitidine has on E0771 development was dependent on MDSCs, gemcitabine treatment was used for depletion of MDSCs *in vivo*.[@cit0024] Analysis of circulating MDSCs a day after gemcitabine treatment revealed that monocytes were preferentially depleted, with no significant alteration in neutrophils ([Fig. 8A](#f0008){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Gemcitabine-treated mice had decreased tumor growth compared to untreated mice, and gemcitabine combined with ranitidine-treated mice showed similar tumor development as those treated with gemcitabine alone ([Fig. 8B-C](#f0008){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Figure 8.Gemcitabine treatment prevents ranitidine-induced tumor growth inhibition. (A) Blood samples were taken from each mouse one day after gemcitabine (or vehicle) injection and stained for myeloid cells. (B) E0771 tumors in C57BL/6 mice treated with ranitidine (8 mg/kg) with/without gemcitabine treatment were measured every 2 d starting 7 d post E0771-GFP cell injection. (C--D) At day 20, the primary tumor was measured (C), excised and weighed (D). Data in (A) represents the mean ± SEM of 4--8 mice/group. Data in (B) represents the mean ± SEM tumor volume of 12--24 mice/point. Data points in (C--D) represent the mean ± SEM of 12--24 mice/group.\n\nLong-term ranitidine treatment is associated with increased latency in breast tumor onset and a decrease in number of tumors in LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice {#s0002-0008}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA spontaneous breast tumor model provides a more similar scenario to clinical cancer, and allows assessment of the impact of potential treatments on early tumor development. Therefore, experiments were performed in LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice, which normally develop mammary tumors within 20--25 weeks of birth.[@cit0047] LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice were given ranitidine in the drinking water, initiated at the time of weaning (21 d after birth). 50% of untreated LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice develop primary mammary tumors by 147 d after birth.[@cit0047] However, in ranitidine-treated mice there was a significant increase in latency of tumorigenesis by an additional 24 d; t~50~ of 171 d ([Fig. 9B](#f0009){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Furthermore, control mice typically have to be euthanized at week 22 due to large tumors and high tumor burden (average of eight tumors/mice) to comply with ethical endpoints. However, mice treated with ranitidine had a reduced tumor burden allowing them to survive until the planned end of the experiment, at week 26. On average, tumor burden at this time point was four tumors/mice, significantly below that observed in the control animals ([Fig. 9C](#f0009){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Figure 9.Ranitidine increased breast tumor onset latency and decreases final tumor numbers in LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice. (A) Representative timeline of experiment. (B) Mice were examined weekly for palpable breast tumors. (C) Endpoint number of tumors was counted. (B) Representative tumor-free survival of control (n=15) and ranitidine-treated (n=10) mice.

Modulation of tumor-associated immune suppression, specifically MDSC populations provides a potential approach to enhancing acquired antitumor immunity which could be effective at multiple stages of tumor development and spread. In the current study, ranitidine treatment *in vivo* caused a decrease in select monocyte populations in both the spleen and the bone marrow of both naïve and breast tumor-bearing mice. Blood from ranitidine-treated, tumor-bearing mice also showed a reduced ability to suppress T cell proliferation, and depleting MDSCs through gemcitabine treatment ablated the effect of ranitidine on tumor growth. H2 antagonists, when administered in drinking water at doses within the clinical therapeutic range, inhibited lung metastasis in the 4T1 breast tumor model and led to inhibition of initial tumor growth in the E0771 breast cancer model. H2 antagonist treatment also increased the time before tumor development and reduced the number of tumors developing in the LKB1^−/−^/NIC mouse model of spontaneous breast tumor development. Overall, H2 blockade was beneficial in these breast tumor models. These results are surprising considering that previous studies report that ranitidine decreases the cytotoxic activity of NK cells[@cit0033] and that histamine signaling through H2 inhibits reactive oxygen species synthesis by monocytes, thereby enhancing NK cell activity.[@cit0048] These findings demonstrate that ranitidine treatment can function at a variety of stages during tumor development and in multiple breast tumor settings, consistent with an impact on tumor-associated immune suppression.\n\nOne previous study has analyzed whether treatment with H2 antagonists can alter breast tumor outcome,[@cit0051] but in these patients, treatment was provided only at very late stages of disease. In keeping with our findings, another study has suggested a decreased risk of developing lung cancer with long-term H2 antagonist treatment.[@cit0052] Our results suggest that H2 antagonists could have a potentially beneficial effect if administered either before tumor development or at an early point in tumor development, particularly in those tumor settings where limiting MDSC function would be beneficial. The beneficial effects of ranitidine treatment are not dependent upon H2 expression by the tumor cells and neither of the injectable tumor models we used expressed this receptor.\n\nAs H2 antagonists block acid secretion in the stomach, this can cause alterations in the intestinal microbiome[@cit0053] which could then alter the immune response.[@cit0054] A recent study revealed that altering the gut microbiome in mice with a predisposition to developing breast tumors increased the number of tumors the mice had, a change that was related to neutrophil activity.[@cit0056] Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that is capable of inhibiting acid secretion without binding H2 receptors. Other studies have shown that omeprazole can inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation *in vitro* and experimental metastasis *in vivo*,[@cit0057] but our results show that, unlike ranitidine, omeprazole treatment does not inhibit E0771 tumor growth.\n\nEight days of ranitidine treatment were associated with a significant decrease in monocytes in the spleen and bone marrow. This is consistent with the known myelo-suppressive effect of ranitidine.[@cit0003] In humans, it is thought that such myelo-depletion is primarily associated with neutropenia.[@cit0004] In mice, the ranitidine-induced depletion we observed was monocyte specific. Previous results have shown that the less selective H2 antagonist cimetidine can cause apoptosis of MDSCs,[@cit0040] but these results were not replicated by the alternate H2 antagonist famotidine, and were not reversed by histamine, suggesting an \"off target\" mechanism of cimetidine action.\n\nIn general, monocytes and macrophages have several pro-tumorigenic effects. Tumor-associated macrophages are important for angiogenesis and microenvironment modulation (for a review, see ref.[@cit0059]). Decreasing the monocyte populations could thereby inhibit tumor growth and development.[@cit0060] The monocyte population of MDSCs is also considered more immunosuppressive than the neutrophil population.[@cit0062] Ranitidine has previously been demonstrated to have a number of effects on monocytes including modulation of adhesion molecule expression, in keeping with the known functions of H2.[@cit0031] However, it remains possible that the impact of ranitidine on monocyte populations may be indirect.\n\nMDSCs are a key cell type involved in immune suppression in cancer and can also directly impact tumor cells to induce growth and metastasis.[@cit0063] Increases in circulating MDSCs correlate with disease progression in breast cancer patients[@cit0065] and circulating MDSCs in cancer patients are shown to inhibit T cell proliferation.[@cit0064] In our experiments, blood leukocytes from ranitidine-treated 4T1 tumor-bearing mice had less suppressive activity on antigen-driven T cell proliferation than those from control tumor bearing mice. These findings confirm that ranitidine treatment causes an alteration in the functional MDSCs in the blood. Both neutrophilic and monocytic MDSCs could contribute to this response. In keeping with these findings, histamine and histamine-producing cells have previously been demonstrated to have a key role in MDSC regulation in mice, although the most profound effects were observed on granulocytic MDSC\\'s.[@cit0041] This study by Martin *et al*[@cit0041] stated that granulocytic MDSCs can be impacted by both H1 and H2 antagonists, but our studies showed no effect by H1 antagonists. This may be in part due to the impact H1 has on other immune cells, which could offset the positive effects H1 blockade has on MDSC inhibition.\n\nNOS2 and Arg1 are often thought of as the predominant mediators in MDSC-mediated suppression but inhibition of these pathways did not significantly modify the suppression of CD4^+^ T cell responses by peripheral blood cells from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. However, some populations of MDSCs have been shown to cause suppression via NOS2- and Arg1-independent mechanisms. MDSCs also synthesize reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in some cases have been shown to be the primary mediator in T cell suppression.[@cit0067] In a study by Nagaraj *et al.*, ROS synthesis was the primary mediator of suppression by MDSC, and when gp91 was knocked out, therefore leading to an inability to produce ROS, MDSC function was lost, while MDSCs deficient in NOS2 still had suppressive activity.[@cit0070] Another study showed that production of TGFβ by MDSCs was very important for hindering tumor immunosurveillance,[@cit0018] and that TGFβ in humans is important for immune suppression with no contribution by NOS2 and Arg1 activity.[@cit0073] Overall, our data may signify that the impact ranitidine had on alterations in immune suppression was dependent on an alteration in the number of MDSCs present in circulation, not due to ranitidine altering expression of NOS2 and Arg1 and also suggests that TGF-β, ROS or a combination of such pathways mediate MDSC function in the blood, in this model.\n\nGemcitabine is widely used as an inhibitor of MDSC\\'s[@cit0024] and was utilized to investigate the role of such MDSCs in the E0771 model of ranitidine-inhibited primary tumor growth. Gemcitabine can selectively cause depletion of MDSCs, while not altering other immune cell numbers.[@cit0025] This depletion was specific to monocytic MDSCs in the E0771 model. Following gemcitabine treatment, ranitidine did not have an effect on tumor development. Notably, other cells from the monocytic lineage, including mature macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are not impacted by short-term gemcitabine treatment.[@cit0074] However, it remains possible that long-term ranitidine treatment could alter TAM populations by altering monocytes that would otherwise be recruited and differentiated into TAMs.\n\nH2 blockade has been shown to alleviate inhibition of IFNγ function[@cit0035] and modify DC function and migration.[@cit0029] Notably, CD8^+^ T cell depletion did not alter ranitidine's effect on 4T1 metastasis. Although CD8^+^ T cells are important in tumor clearance, they are not the only cell involved.[@cit0075] MDSCs have been reported to have inhibitory effects on several immune effector cell types including NK cells[@cit0018] and CD4^+^ T cells[@cit0076] directly,[@cit0021] or via inhibition of DC function[@cit0020] or induction of regulatory T cell development.[@cit0078] In addition, antibody-mediated processes such as complement mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity can also be affected by MDSCs.\n\nIn this study, ranitidine had an impact on three distinct models of breast cancer. We have confirmed that this is not due to a direct effect on the tumor cells in the two orthotopic models used. The different degrees and levels of tumor inhibition may be attributed to the differences in mouse genetic backgrounds[@cit0079] and/or the differences in the biology of the tumors themselves as they interact with the immune system. 4T1 cells are not highly immunogenic.[@cit0081] Modification of monocyte populations, such as MDSCs, has previously been shown to profoundly affect the ability of the 4T1 tumor model to metastasize.[@cit0042] The E0771 cell line appeared to be more vulnerable to immune changes mediated by ranitidine at the primary tumor site. In the LKB1^−/−^/NIC model of spontaneous breast cancer, ranitidine is given over a longer period of time, which allows the ranitidine to modify immune effector cell populations prior to tumor development. The impact of ranitidine-induced MDSC changes on tumor growth and spread will likely vary extensively between tumors and also be related to other effects of ranitidine on immune function of importance in regulating tumor growth or metastasis. Overall, these studies highlight the profound impact that widely used H2 antagonists can have on antitumor immune function and suggest the use of these agents may provide opportunities to reduce tumor-associated immune suppression in breast cancer or reduce breast cancer development in those at high risk.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the commonly used H2 antagonist ranitidine can affect monocyte populations in both normal and tumor-bearing animals. Consistent with an inhibition of MDSC populations, ranitidine treatment can also inhibit breast tumor development and spread in three separate breast tumor models including a model of spontaneous breast tumor development. These results suggest that it may be beneficial to consider including a H2 antagonists, as opposed to other regulators of gastric acid secretion, in the context of breast cancer therapy or prevention. Clinical studies are urgently required to address these issues.\n\nMethods {#s0004}\n=======\n\nCell lines {#s0004-0001}\n----------\n\nMouse epithelial breast carcinoma cell line 4T1 and mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell line E0771 (ATCC) transduced with GFP were maintained in a monolayer in Dulbecco\\'s Modified Eagle's Medium (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% [L]{.smallcaps}-glutamine, HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin. Selection for GFP-positive E0771 was maintained with 4 μg/mL of puromycin in the media.\n\nMice {#s0004-0002}\n----\n\nAll mouse experiments were pre-approved by the Dalhousie University Committee on Laboratory Animals. Five week old female BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions at the Carleton Animal Care Facility at Dalhousie University. LKB1^−/−^/NIC female mice were bred at Dalhousie University.\n\nIn vivo orthotopic breast cancer model {#s0004-0003}\n--------------------------------------\n\nHistamine antagonists were added to drinking water one day prior to tumor cell injection and were refreshed every other day. These histamine antagonists remain stable in the drinking water during this time.[@cit0083] The water bottles at this time were weighed before and after the water was changed, to be able to calculate the amount of water drank by each mouse and calculate the amount of drug taken in per mouse. Using this approach, the consumption of drug per mouse per day ranged 6--8 mg/kg. Omeprazole (O104, Sigma Aldrich) was mixed into mash (5 g/mouse/d) at an amount that would give each mouse 70 mg/kg, and given to mice every day, starting one day prior to tumor cell injection.\n\nAn adaptation of the protocol of Pulaski and Ostrand-Rosenberg[@cit0085] was employed for orthotopic models. 6--8 week old BALB/c female mice were anesthetized and 100,000 4T1 cells in 50 μL PBS were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad near the fourth nipple. The volume of the tumor was determined by caliper measurements every second day using the equation volume = length × width^2^/2. At day 7 or day 19--21 post injection, the mice were sacrificed and the primary tumor, spleen, femurs, and lungs were collected. The lungs were digested for one hour at 37°C in the following enzyme cocktail in HBSS: 300 U/mL collagenase VII (C2139, Sigma Aldrich), 6 U/mL elastase (LE425, Elastin Products Company, Inc.), 100 μg/mL DNAse I (11-284-932-001, Roche), 2.5 mM calcium chloride (Fisher), and 2.5 mM magnesium chloride (M2670, Sigma Aldrich), then pushed through a 100 μm nylon filter. Serial dilutions were plated in media containing 60 μM 6-thioguanine (cat. \\#154-42-7, Alfa Aesar). After 9--12 d of incubation, the 4T1 colonies were fixed and stained with 0.03% methylene blue (M9140, Sigma Aldrich) solution. The plates were scanned using an HP Scanjet G4050 scanner and the colonies were counted using ImageJ software.\n\nFor the E0771 model, 6--8 week old female C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and 200,000 cells in 100 μL of Matrigel® (Corning) were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad near the fourth nipple. Tumor size was tracked as described above with tumors harvested and weighed at day 21.\n\nSpontaneous tumor development model {#s0004-0004}\n-----------------------------------\n\nAt the time of weaning (approximately 4 weeks), female LKB1^−/−^/NIC mice[@cit0047] were given either control or ranitidine containing water. Drug-treated water was refreshed three times per week. Mice were examined once a week starting at week 19 for tumors and tumor volume was quantified using calipers in a similar method as mentioned above. A mouse was considered tumor bearing when a tumor was palpable and measurable by calipers. At week 23--26, mice were sacrificed and the primary tumors were counted and weighed.\n\nIn vivo CD8^+^ cell depletion {#s0004-0005}\n-----------------------------\n\nPurified anti-CD8^+^ antibody (Clone 53--6.7) was generously provided by Dr Thomas Issekutz (Dalhousie University). LEAF™ Purified Rat IgG2a κ isotype control was purchased from Biolegend (Cat. \\#400533).\n\nTwo days prior to 4T1 tumor cell injection, 200 μg of either anti-CD8^+^ antibody or the isotype control was injected intraperitoneally in BALB/c mice. Eight days post tumor cell injection, 100 μg of antibody was injected intraperitoneally. The efficacy of CD8^+^ depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples.\n\nIn vivo MDSC depletion {#s0004-0006}\n----------------------\n\nThe E0771 model was utilized as stated above with ranitidine treatment beginning one day prior to tumor cell injection. Five and 13 d post tumor cell injection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with gemcitabine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg, G6423, Sigma Aldrich) or vehicle. On day 6 and day 14, the efficacy of gemcitabine to deplete monocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples.\n\nFlow cytometry {#s0004-0007}\n--------------\n\nAntibodies: Rat anti-mouse CD11b-fluorescein isothiocyanate (cat. \\#11--0112, eBioscience), rat anti-mouse Ly6G-biotin (cat. \\#12760, Biolegend), rat anti-mouse Ly6C-allophycocyanin (APC) (cat. \\#17--5932, eBioscience). Appropriate isotype matched control antibodies were used in all experiments.\n\nSplenocytes and bone marrow cells were blocked in FACS buffer containing rat serum. Samples were then mixed with primary antibodies for 15 min on ice, washed, and mixed with streptavidin PerCP for 20 min at 4°C. Following washing, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and acquired for analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria II. Results were analyzed using FCS Express software (De Novo Software).\n\nT cell suppression assay {#s0004-0008}\n------------------------\n\nMice were treated with ranitidine and injected with 4T1 cells as described above. At day 14 post 4T1 injection, peripheral blood was isolated via cardiac puncture. Red blood cells were lysed and leukocytes were resuspended in complete RPMI (Hyclone) media (10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% [L]{.smallcaps}-glutamine, HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin) to a volume equal to the amount originally isolated from each mouse. Samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates in triplicate, before adding D011.10 splenocytes.\n\nSpleens obtained from D011.10 mice were isolated, red blood cells were lysed, and leukocytes were counted. Splenocytes were labeled using 1 μM Oregon Green® 488 dye (O-6149, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in RPMI at 37°C for 15 min. Cells were washed and 200,000 splenocytes were added per well. To each well, 10 μM OVA^323--339^ peptide was added and the cells were cultured. To determine whether the suppressive effect was dependent on NOS2 and Arg1 activity, L-NMMA and/or nor-NOHA (500 µM) was added.[@cit0044] At day 3, each well was washed and stained with anti-mouse CD4^+^-PE (cat. \\#12--004, eBioscience), fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and acquired using a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur.

We are told to avoid buying plastic, to reuse plastic bags, to make small differences.\n\nBut to truly impact the climate crisis, we need the companies who produce the products we buy to reduce their usage of unnecessary plastic packaging, so that we are able, as consumers, to choose more sustainable products. This is why, upon, noticing the plastic seal on my Hellman's mayo jar, which serves no true purpose and is thrown away immediately upon opening it, I decided to email Hellman's about this ridiculous and, ultimately, polluting, plastic use.\n\nDisappointingly, but predictably, the response was a list of promises: \"Unilever has made an industry-leading commitment...\"; \"\"we have a framework,\"; \"our Five Point Plastic Plan.\". However, the theme was clear: \"by 2025,\"; \"working to accelerate this process.\"; \"ambitious 2025 targets.\": the action is not immediate, and their commitments are not enough.\n\nThis petition is my response. As a consumer, I do not think that these words and promises are enough. I want action now, and removing these unnecessary plastic seals would be the first step towards a sustainable and climate-stable future, in which my buying of everyday food items does not have to involve 'climate guilt'.\n\nPlease join me in requesting Hellman's to remove these unnecessary plastic seals and paving the way - in action, not plans and promises - towards a more sustainable future.

{"text": "Virus Spike and Membrane-Lytic Mimicking Nanoparticles for High Cell Binding and Superior Endosomal Escape.\nVirus-inspired mimics for gene therapy have attracted increasing attention because viral vectors show robust efficacy owing to the highly infectious nature and efficient endosomal escape. Nonetheless, until now, synthetic materials have failed to achieve high \"infectivity,\" and especially, the mimicking of virus spikes for \"infection\" is underappreciated. Herein, a virus spike mimic by a zinc (Zn) coordinative ligand that shows high affinity toward phosphate-rich cell membranes is reported. Surprisingly, this ligand also demonstrates superior functionality of destabilizing endosomes. Therefore, the Zn coordination is more likely to imitate the virus nature with high cell binding and endosomal membrane disruption. Following this, the Zn coordinative ligand is functionalized on a bioreducible cross-linked peptide with alkylation that imitates the viral lipoprotein shell. The ultimate virus-mimicking nanoparticle closely imitates the structures and functions of viruses, leading to robust transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, apart from targeting ligand- and cell-penetrating peptide, the metal coordinative ligand may provide another option to functionalize diverse biomaterials for enhanced efficacy, demonstrating its broad referential significance to pursue nonviral vectors with high performance.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy.\nPulmonary toxicity can rarely be seen with cytotoxic agents. We aimed at investigating the pulmonary toxicity of docetaxel in patients other than lung carcinoma. Forty patients were investigated prospectively. Spirometry, DLCO and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were applied to all patients before and 14-21 days after completion of docetaxel. We used a HRCT scoring system that was based on the previous studies. We have seen no pulmonary symptoms that may reflect pulmonary toxicity. There were statistically significant differences between pre- and post-treatment values of FEV1 (L/s), FEV1/FVC (%), DLCO/VA (DLCO/L), DLCO/VA (%) (P<0.05), FEF25-75 (L/s), FEF25-75 (%) (P<0.01), DLCO (mL/mmHg/min), DLCO (%) (P<0.001), Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-treatment HRCT scores. There was a statistical relationship between post-treatment HRCT scores, number of docetaxel cycles (r=0.49, P<0.0001) and docetaxel cumulative dose (r=0.61, P<0.0001). Docetaxel caused a significant decline in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and progression in HRCT scores but the symptoms of patients were not consistent with these differences. The negative effects of docetaxel on PFTs and HRCT scores should be investigated more reliably by increasing the number of patients with further studies.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Analysis of promoter region polymorphism in the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) as a risk factor for myocardial infarction.\nSeveral polymorphisms in genes of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system have been found to have pleiotropic effects on cardiovascular disorders. Recently, a polymorphism (-344 C/T) in the promoter region of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2), which may influence plasma aldosterone levels, has been reported to strongly influence left ventricular diameters and mass in young adults and arterial stiffness in essential hypertensives. We investigated any association with risk of myocardial infarction (MI). CYP11B2 -344 polymorphism genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 542 acute MI cases and 500 control subjects without history of coronary disease. All subjects were white and <75 years old. There was no significant difference in either genotype distributions (cases CC 17%, CT 52%, TT 31%; controls CC 22%, CT 47%, TT 31%, P = .10) or allele frequencies (cases C/T 0.43/0.57, controls C/T 0.46/0.54, P = .39) between cases and controls. The odds ratio (OR) for MI associated with the CC genotype was 0.75 (0.54-1.05), and remained insignificant when analysis was restricted to the 129 (24%) cases and 193 (37%) controls < 55 years of age (OR 0.68 [0.36-1.27], P = .20). In further analyses, there was no interaction of the polymorphism with other cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, or cholesterol level) in determining MI risk, and the polymorphism did not influence the frequency of these risk factors in either cases or controls. In the case cohort, age at MI was not significantly different in subjects with the three genotypes (CC 61.2 +/- 9.8 years, CT 61.8 +/- 9.1 years, TT 62.2 +/- 9.0 years, P = .69). We conclude that the aldosterone synthase -344 promoter region polymorphism does not significantly influence the risk of MI either directly or via interaction with other risk factors.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Vulvodynia and chronic pelvic pain in a gynecologic outpatient clinic.\nIntroduction: Vulvodynia and chronic pelvic pain are common but underdiagnosed chronic gynecologic pain syndromes. Insufficient knowledge regarding prevalence, typical pain patterns and associated factors contribute to delayed diagnosis. The present study explored the symptoms and characteristics of women presenting with vulvodynia and/or chronic pelvic pain to a gynecologic outpatient clinic. Materials and methods: Electronic charts of women diagnosed with vulvodynia and/or chronic pelvic pain between January 2010 and December 2015 were reviewed. Type of pain, duration of symptoms, previous medical assessments and therapies, comorbidities and patient characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven women (mean age 36, range 18-75 years) met the diagnostic criteria for chronic gynecologic pain syndromes. Sixty-five women were diagnosed with CPP only, 42 with vulvodynia and 20 with both conditions. Endometriosis was suspected or diagnosed in 35 (54%) women with CPP. History of pain ranged from 3 months to 20 years. Comorbidities were common, with 40% of women being diagnosed with depression or other mood disorders, 15% with urological and 9% with gastrointestinal conditions. Conclusions: There is a need for increased awareness regarding vulvodynia and CPP among health care providers. A comprehensive history is important for adequate diagnosis.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThis action arises out of a dispute that has lasted more than a decade. It has spawned numerous administrative, state, and federal court proceedings directed to the question of whether the members of Congregation Etz Chaim may conduct religious services at a house located at 303 South Highland Avenue (\"the Highland property\") in Los Angeles, California (\"the City\").\n\nA. The Commencement and Settlement of the Congregation Etz Chaim Action\nThe Highland property is located in an area that is zoned R-1 (primarily residential) pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code § 12.08. As a result, Congregation Etz Chaim applied to the City for a conditional use permit (\"CUP\") to operate a house of prayer at the Highland property. On October 16, 1996, the City's Zoning Administrator denied this application. The Zoning Administrator's decision was upheld by the Board of Zoning Appeals and sustained by the Los Angeles City Council.\nOn July 10, 1997, Congregation Etz Chaim and the individual members thereof (collectively, \"the Congregation\") commenced an action against the City, CV 97-5042-CAS (the \"Congregation Etz Chaim action\") alleging that the City's denial of its application for a CUP violated federal and state law. Following the enactment of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc (\"RLUIPA\"), the Congregation filed a second amended complaint, alleging that, in addition to its other claims for relief, the City's actions violated RLUIPA. On September 27, 2001, the Congregation and the City entered into a written settlement agreement (\"the Settlement Agreement\") resolving this action. Subsequently, on February 1, 2002, the Court entered a Notice of Dismissal and Order (\"the Dismissal Order\") dismissing this case *1123 with prejudice pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provided that religious worship could take place at the Highland property subject to certain conditions. Dismissal Order, Ex. A (Settlement Agreement) § VI.\n\nB. The Instant Action\nOn July 10, 2003, the League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates and individual Hancock Park homeowners (collectively, the \"LRNA\"), none of whom were parties to the Congregation Etz Chaim action, filed the instant action in this Court against Congregation Etz Chaim, the Rubin Family Exemption Trust, the City, then Mayor James Hahn, and City Attorney Rockard Delgadillo (collectively, \"City defendants\"). League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates v. City of Los Angeles, CV 03-4890 CAS (Ex). The LRNA sought (1) a declaration that the Settlement Agreement is invalid under federal and state law and (2) an injunction prohibiting use of the Highland property as a place for religious worship on the grounds that such use does not conform to applicable zoning laws and violates various provisions of the California and United States Constitutions. In an order dated September 15, 2003, the Court granted a motion by defendants Congregation Etz Chaim and the Rubin Family Exemption Trust to dismiss the LRNA's complaint with leave to amend. The Court stated that \"[t]he complaint should be amended to allege the real question at issue, which is whether plaintiffs have standing to collaterally attack the settlement reached in the previous action, including whether the City had the power to settle the challenges posed to it in the previous action.\" The LRNA filed their first amended complaint on October 9, 2003, against Congregation Etz Chaim, Mayor James Hahn, and City Attorney Rockard Delgadillo (\"the City defendants\"). On December 22, 2003, the Court granted Congregation Etz Chaim's motion to dismiss the first amended complaint with prejudice. The Court stated in relevant part that:\nOne basic and fundamental assumption underlies claims 1 through 9. The assumption is that the settlement agreement granted Congregation [Etz Chaim] a CUP without going through the procedures required by the ordinances of City and California statutory law before a CUP was granted. Plaintiff argues that the right of nearby residents to take part in the hearing process on the application for a CUP is a property right which cannot be evaded without violating the Due Process Clause and other constitutional provisions. The defect in plaintiff's argument is that the premise is wrong. The settlement agreement did not create a CUP. It was reached on a compromise basis with Congregation and City each giving up certain strongly held positions to obtain a settlement ... The City Charter, § 273(c), expressly allows City to settle litigation against it. This settlement agreement was negotiated thoroughly before Magistrate Judge Eick, was submitted to the City Council after final approval by the attorneys, was considered twice by the City Council, and approved.\nSee December 22, 2003 Order at 5-6. The Court concluded that \"the settlement agreement does not create a CUP within the meaning of the zoning acts,\" and therefore \"all of the deficiencies alleged against it fail.\" December 22, 2003 Order at 6-7. The City defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on March 5, 2004. On April 22, 2004, the Court granted their motion with leave to amend, concluding that the \"law of the case established by the December 22, 2003 Order [bars] any claim predicated on the theory that the Settlement Agreement is a de facto CUP.\" See April 22, 2004 Order at 8.\n*1124 The LRNA filed its second amended complaint (\"SAC\") on May 6, 2004. Rather than alleging that the Settlement Agreement was a \"de facto CUP,\" the SAC alleged that the City granted plaintiffs \"a contractual CUP or non-statutory contractual use permission.\" See, e.g., Second Amended Compl. ¶ 47. The first three claims of the SAC sought a declaration that the settlement was invalid based on (1) violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) violations of the Due Process Clause of Article I, Section 7 of the California Constitution; (3) violations of state law. The fourth claim of the SAC sought mandamus to compel enforcement of the City's zoning laws. The next two claims sought to enjoin the use of the Highland Property as a place for religious worship pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the basis of violations of (1) the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (2) the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Finally, the SAC also sought an injunction based on (1) the Establishment Clause of Article I, § 4 of the California Constitution; (2) the Equal Protection Clause of Article I, § 7 of the California Constitution; and (3) nonconforming use in violation of applicable zoning laws.\nOn July 13, 2004, the Court granted with prejudice the City defendants' motion to dismiss the SAC. The Court held that because the Settlement Agreement was neither a CUP or a \"de facto CUP,\" by entering into the Settlement Agreement, the City had not violated the Los Angeles Municipal Code or the California Government Code provisions governing the issuance of a CUP or the procedures for settling municipal litigation. The Court also rejected the LRNA's arguments that the Settlement Agreement constituted an impermissible delegation of City authority or that it violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses or the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\nPlaintiffs thereafter appealed the Court's December 13, 2003 and July 13, 2004 orders. On May 13, 2006, the Ninth Circuit remanded the instant action to this Court for reconsideration of the July 13, 2004 order in light of the California Court of Appeals' decision in Trancas v. City of Malibu, 138 Cal.App.4th 172, 41 Cal. Rptr.3d 200 (2006). In Trancas, the court invalidated a city's decision to settle a lawsuit by granting the functional equivalent of a zoning variance without complying with statutory zoning procedures. Id. at 181-82, 41 Cal.Rptr.3d 200. On August 14, 2006, based on the Court's conclusion in its earlier orders that the Settlement Agreement was not a de facto CUP, the Court distinguished Trancas, and affirmed its July 13, 2004 order granting the City defendants' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.\nThe LRNA appealed again, and on August 21, 2007, the Ninth Circuit reversed. League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates v. City of Los Angeles, 498 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir.2007) (\"LRNA\"). The court pointed out that pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code §§ 12.08(A) and 12.24(T)(3)(b), the operation of a \"house of worship\" in an R-1 district requires the issuance of a CUP, and that before such a permit may be issued, there must be public notice and a hearing, factual findings, and an opportunity for appeal. Id. at 1055-56. The court stated that a federal settlement agreement cannot provide a means for state officials to evade state law. Id. at 1055 (citing Keith v. Volpe, 118 F.3d 1386, 1393 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that state officials \"could not agree to terms which would exceed their authority and supplant state law\")). Thus, a municipality cannot waive or consent to a violation of *1125 its zoning laws, and any agreement by the municipality to circumvent its zoning laws is \"invalid and unenforceable.\" Id. at 1056. Because the Settlement Agreement allowed the Congregation to engage in congregational worshipa \"conditional use\" under the Los Angeles Municipal Codewithout obtaining a CUP, the court held that the Settlement Agreement was invalid and unenforceable under California law. Id. at 1056-57.\nThe court went on to state, however, that the City would not have to comply with its zoning laws if such compliance had led to or would result in a violation of federal law. Id. at 1057-58. Thus, the court held, upon properly supported findings that the Settlement Agreement is required to remedy an actual violation of federal law, the Settlement Agreement would be enforceable, notwithstanding its conflict with the City's zoning laws. Id. at 1058. But the Court had made no findings that federal lawin this case, RLUIPA had been violated or would be violated. In the absence of such findings, the court concluded, because the Settlement Agreement provided for violations of the City's zoning laws, this agreement was invalid and unenforceable. Id.\nAfter the Ninth Circuit's decision, the LRNA moved in the Ninth Circuit for an award of attorneys' fees incurred on appeal pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The City opposed the LRNA's motion. On May 13, 2008, the Ninth Circuit issued an order which stated, in its entirety \"Appellants League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates, et al.'s motion for attorney fees in the amount of $116,319.90 is GRANTED.\"\nOn April 24, 2009, in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in this action, the Court entered judgment in favor of the LRNA and against defendants, finding the settlement agreement between defendants to be invalid and unenforceable under California law.[1]\n\nC. The Instant Proceedings\nOn May 8, 2009, the LRNA filed the instant motion for award of attorneys' fees against defendant City of Los Angeles (the \"City\"). The City filed an opposition on June 1, 2009. A reply was filed on June 8, 2009. A hearing was held on June 15, 2009. After carefully considering the arguments set forth by the parties, the Court finds and concludes as follows.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (\"§ 1988\"), in an action brought under, inter alia, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs ...\" \"[S]uccessful plaintiffs should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\" Sethy v. Alameda County Water District, 602 F.2d 894, 897 (9th Cir.1979). \"The defendant has the burden of showing special circumstances warrant a denial of fees and the defendant's showing must be a strong one.\" Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 743 (9th Cir.1989).\nThe LRNA argues that it is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in relation to the district court proceedings, because (1) such an award is compelled by the law of the case doctrine and (2) as the prevailing party, it is entitled to attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n*1126 \"The law of the case doctrine states that the decision of an appellate court on a legal issue must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.\" Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 12 F.3d 901, 904 (9th Cir.1993). \"The doctrine is a judicial invention designed to aid in the efficient operation of court affairs. Under the doctrine, a court is generally precluded from reconsidering an issue previously decided by the same court, or a higher court in the identical case. For the doctrine to apply, the issue in question must have been decided explicitly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.\" Id. \"[E]ven summarily treated issues become the law of the case.\" Leslie Salt Co. v. United States, 55 F.3d 1388, 1392 (9th Cir.1995).\nThe LRNA argues that the law of the case doctrine extends to the Circuit's decision on plaintiffs motion for attorneys' fees. Mot. at 3. In other words, because the Ninth Circuit found that the LRNA was entitled to its attorneys' fees expended on the appeal under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the LRNA is necessarily entitled to such fees incurred in relation to the district court proceedings. Reply at 1, citing Vernon v. City of Los Angeles, 27 F.3d 1385, 1402 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[t]he same standard is applied when analyzing requests for attorney fees at both the trial and appellate levels\").\nThe City counters that the law of the case doctrine has no application here, because the Ninth Circuit did not decide on the merits the issue of fees in the district court proceedings. The City cites Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. E.E.O.C., 691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982). In Liberty, the district court denied defendant's motion to amend an injunction and denied defendant's motion for costs. Id. at 440. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with regard to the motion to amend and granted defendant's motion for their costs on appeal, but was silent on the district court's denial of costs. Id. On remand in the district court, the court declined to award costs, finding that the original denial of costs in the district court had been affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, and an award of costs was therefore barred. Id. The Ninth Circuit rejected plaintiff's argument that its decision reversing the district court and remanding decided the issue of the award of costs. Id. at 441. The Liberty court held that \"[l]ower courts are free to decide issues on remand so long as they were not decided on a prior appeal ... Thus, the law of the case would preclude the district court from reconsidering only issues decided explicitly or by necessary implication in this court's previous disposition.\" Id. at 441. The court further stated\nAlthough in its previous appeal the state contested the district court's denial of costs, our prior disposition awarded the state only its costs on appeal. The disposition was completely silent as to the issue of costs in the district court. Liberty argues that this silence amounts to an implicit denial of costs in the district court. There is no reason, however, why our earlier silence did not simply leave the matter of costs open for consideration by the district court on remand.\nId. The City analogizes to Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. and argues that \"the argument against the application of the law of the case doctrine is even stronger in this matter where the Ninth Circuit's motion panel was only confronted with the issue of fees and costs for the appellate work. The issue of attorney's fees in the district court for the trial work was neither before the Ninth Circuit nor decided by that court.\" Opp'n at 3; see also Mirchandani v. U.S., 836 F.2d 1223, 1225 (9th Cir.1988) (\"district courts are not free to decide issues on remand that were previously decided either expressly or by necessary implication on appeal ... Such a rule applies, however, *1127 only with respect to issues previously determined by the appellate court. It has no application where no appellate decision had issued on the merits\").\nThe LRNA replies by citing Burger King Corp. v. Pilgrim's Pride Corp., 15 F.3d 166, 169 (11th Cir.1994). In Burger King, the district court awarded fees under the Lanham Act following a ruling by the Eleventh Circuit that fees were appropriate at the appellate level. Defendant appealed the award of fees in the district court. In affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that:\nthis court explicitly held that [plaintiff] was entitled to recover attorney's fees when it granted [plaintiff's] petition for attorney fees on appeal. In reaching that decision, this court decided, through necessary implication, that this case was exceptional within the meaning of Section 35 of the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). This implicit ruling makes exceptionality the law of the case, binding this court in the present appeal. Therefore, the law of the case dictates that [defendant] may not challenge the district court's authority to award attorney's fees, only the amount. Because [defendant] only challenged the basis for the award, not the amount of the award, we affirm the district court.\nId.\nThe Court finds that although, in awarding attorneys' fees in the appellate action, the Ninth Circuit did not directly address the question of whether the LRNA is entitled to attorneys' fees for work in the district court proceedings, the Ninth Circuit may have, by implication, made findings that are relevant to the issue of whether attorneys' fees are warranted. The Court is bound by any such findings as the law of the case. The Court therefore examines the specific elements of a request for attorneys' fees under § 1988.\n\nA. Prevailing Party\nSection 1988 provides that attorneys' fees are awarded to the prevailing party. A party is prevailing when it has \"succeeded on any significant issue in the litigation which achieved some benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\" Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-792, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989).\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that \"even unadjudicated claims can support an award of attorneys' fees under § 1988 as long as those claims are substantial and were not alleged solely to support the fee award.\" Native Village of Venetie IRA Council v. Alaska, 155 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir.1998). \"Therefore, the [requesting party] need only show that at least one of their claims falls within the remedial scheme of § 1983 and remained a sufficiently substantial claim throughout the litigation to trigger the fee-shifting provision of § 1988.\" Id.; see also Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. City of El Paso, 346 F.3d 541, 551 (5th Cir.2003) (\"[o]ur precedent is clear that if [plaintiff] states a § 1983 claim based on the alleged violation of constitutional rights that supports federal question jurisdiction, that is sufficient to support the award of attorney's fees, even if the constitutional claim is avoided by the court. It is not necessary for [plaintiff] to prevail on the constitutional claim\").\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that \"for the purpose of qualifying a prevailing party, an unaddressed, fee-supporting claim supports an award of fees if it is both substantial and arises from a common nucleus of operative fact with a dispositive, non-fee-supporting claim addressed by the court.\" Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Garamendi, 400 F.3d 803, 808 (9th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added). \"Claims arise from a common nucleus of operative fact where fee-supporting claims are so interrelated with non-fee claims that plaintiffs *1128 would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\" Id. at 808-09.\nThe LRNA argues that it is the prevailing party in this action for the purposes of § 1988. First, the LRNA argues that the law of the case requires the Court to find the LRNA to be the prevailing party, because the Ninth Circuit has awarded fees to the LRNA under § 1988, despite the fact that the LRNA prevailed in this action on the basis of its state law claim, rather than based on its § 1983 claims. Mot. at 4. The LRNA notes that it argued on appeal that its victory qualified it for a fee award because its state law claims and § 1983 claims arose out of a common nucleus of operative facts, and because its 1983 claims were substantial; the LRNA notes that while the City challenged the LRNA on these issues, the LRNA prevailed and was awarded its fee request in its entirety. Mot. at 4.\nSecond, the LRNA argues that, even if the law of the case doctrine were not applicable, there is no doubt that the LRNA was the prevailing party in this action. Mot. at 6. First, the LRNA argues that the § 1983 claim arose \"from a common nucleus of operative fact with the dispositive, non-fee-supporting claim addressed by the court\" because all of the LRNA's claims arose out of the City's contractual grant of land use permission, and the Congregation's use of Highland Property pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Mot. at 9. See Gerling, 400 F.3d at 808. Furthermore, the LRNA argues that the Court of Appeals recognized this Court's jurisdiction over the LRNA' state law claims, and that this recognition \"is necessarily a holding that the LRNA's state law claims derive from a common nucleus of operative facts and are such that a plaintiff would ordinarily be expected to try them in one judicial proceeding.\" Mot. at 9, citing Trustees of Construction, etc. v. Desert Valley Landscape, 333 F.3d 923, 925 (9th Cir.2003) (explaining supplemental jurisdiction test); League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates v. City of Los Angeles, 498 F.3d 1052, 1055 (9th Cir.2007) (\"[t]he district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the League's constitutional claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a), and over its state claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a)\").\nFurthermore, the LRNA argues that it raised \"substantial federal constitutional claims\" in this action Mot. at 10; see Gerling, 400 F.3d at 808. Specifically, a claim is substantial for purposes of a § 1988 fee request if it meets the \"substantiality\" test for purposes of federal question jurisdiction. See Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 346 F.3d at 551 (\"[a] claim is substantial if it supports federal question jurisdiction\"). A claim is substantial unless it is \"so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy within the jurisdiction of the District Court, whatever may be the ultimate resolution of the federal issues on the merits.\" Cook v. Peter Kiewit Sons Co., 775 F.2d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir.1985). The LRNA argues that because the Ninth Circuit determined that this Court has jurisdiction over the LRNA's federal constitutional claims, the substantiality test is necessarily satisfied. Mot. at 10. Furthermore, the LRNA argues that the LRNA's § 1983 claims could not be considered to be \"insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court or otherwise completely devoid of merit ...\" Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 346 F.3d at 551.[2]\n*1129 The City incorporates by reference the arguments it made before the Ninth Circuit as to why the LRNA is not a prevailing party, namely: (1) the only issued litigated by the LRNA and decided by this Court and the Ninth Circuit was a limited issue of state law; (2) there is no common nucleus of operative facts between the state law issue and the federal claims on which it prevailed. However, the Court finds these arguments to be unavailing. The Ninth Circuit in this case necessarily determined that the LRNA was a prevailing party for the purpose of a fee award pursuant to § 1988. The Court is bound by this finding. Furthermore, even if the law of the case doctrine did not apply, the Court finds that the LRNA did raise substantial federal claims in this case, and the state and federal claims in this action necessarily arise from a common nucleus of operative facts: the Congregation's use of the Highland Property pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\n\nB. Whether Fees are Unjust\n\"Successful plaintiffs should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\" Sethy, 602 F.2d at 897. The \"special circumstances\" test is narrowly construed. See Herrington v. County of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 743 (9th Cir. 1989). The Ninth Circuit generally examines two factors in determining whether a case involves \"special circumstances\" that would justify the denial of fees: \"(1) whether allowing attorney fees would further the purposes of § 1988 and (2) whether the balance of the equities favors or disfavors the denial of fees.\" Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, 177 F.3d 839, 878 (9th Cir.1999).\nThe City argues that awarding attorneys' fees would not further the purpose of § 1988, Opp'n at 6. First, the City argues that it is indisputable that this Court had a hand in the settlement agreement at the center of this case. Opp'n at 6. Furthermore, the City argues that \"Judge Hupp would later reflect on, defend, and justify the settlement agreement at various hearings on motions to dismiss this action.\" Opp'n at 7, citing 12/22/03 Hearing Trans. at 392:7-14 (Judge Hupp: \"[t]he city had its choice. They sat down and determined that their best interest and the best interest of its citizens was not to litigate this thing to the bloody end, but to use their power to settle litigation, to settle here in a way where both parties, gave up some strongly held beliefs in that contract, which is, of course the hallmark of a compromise settlement, and settled the litigation\"). The City argues that the background of the settlement agreement \"is a trenchant illustration of the City's good faith in settling with the Congregation\" and that this good faith is a special circumstance justifying a denial of attorneys' fees.\nFurthermore, the City argues that the balance of equities favors a denial of attorneys' fees in this action. The City argues in particular that the LRNA \"are not the innocent victims of the settlement agreement they are portraying themselves to be. They could (and should) have intervened [in the Congregation Etz Chaim action] but failed to do so.\" Opp'n at 8. The City argues that \"[t]here is no doubt that had the League intervened in the underlying Congregation action, there would not have been a settlement.\" Opp'n at 9. Furthermore, the City argues that the LRNA has already been awarded *1130 $116,319.90 in attorneys' fees and costs by the Ninth Circuit, and that the balance of the equities renders a further award inappropriate. Opp'n at 10.\nIn addition, The City argues that the Court brokered the settlement agreement and approved its language and substance, and therefore, this approval was the superseding cause of the alleged wrong to LRNA. Opp'n at 11, citing Stevenson v. Koskey, 877 F.2d 1435, 1438 (9th Cir.1989) (\"federal courts turn to the causation factors developed in the common law of torts to supply the necessary causation factor in the civil rights field\"); Egervary v. Young, 366 F.3d 238, 246 (3d Cir.2004) (\"an intervening act of a third party, which actively operates to produce harm after the first person's wrongful act has been committed, is a superseding cause which prevents the first person from being liable for the harm which his antecedent wrongful act was a substantial factor in bringing about\"); Murray v. Earle, 405 F.3d 278, 293 (5th Cir.2005) (\"an intervening decision of an informed, neutral decision-maker `breaks' the chain of causation\").\nThe LRNA counters that the City argued this issue to the Ninth Circuit and necessarily lost, and that, therefore, the law of the case dictates that fees are not unjust in this action. Mot. at 4. The Court agrees. The City raised similar arguments regarding its good faith, the LRNA's duty to intervene in the Congregation action, and the Court's role in the settlement agreement in the Ninth Circuit proceedings, and necessarily by implication lost on these arguments. See Pl's Ex. B (City Ninth Circuit Opp'n) at 10-13. Furthermore, even if the law of the case did not dictate such a finding, the City has failed to establish that an award of attorneys' fees would be unjust. First, the City's argument regarding its good faith is insufficient, given that \"[t]here are several reasons ... for accepting the prevailing view that good faith by itself is not a special circumstance justifying a denial of attorney's fees.\" Teitelbaum v. Sorenson, 648 F.2d 1248, 1250 (9th Cir.1981).[3] Furthermore, the Court finds the City's argument regarding causation and the LRNA's failure to intervene to be unpersuasive and insufficient to satisfy the narrowly construed \"special circumstances\" test.[4]See Herrington, 883 F.2d at 743.\n\nC. Reasonableness of the Fees\n\n1. Extent of LRNA's Success\n\"The extent of a plaintiff's success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney's fees under § 1988.\" Webb v. Sloan, 330 F.3d 1158, 1168 (9th Cir.2003). The Court must consider first \"whether the plaintiff failed to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded. Claims are `unrelated' if they are `entirely distinct and separate' from the claims on which the plaintiff prevailed.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). Second, the Court must consider whether plaintiff achieved \"a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award[.]\" McCown v. *1131 City of Fontana, 565 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir.2009).\nHowever, \"in a lawsuit where the plaintiff presents different claims for relief that `involve a common core of facts' or are based on `related legal theories,' the district court should not attempt to divide the request for attorney's fees on a claim-by-claim basis.\" McCown, 565 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.2009). Instead, the Court should proceed to the second prong of the analysis \"and focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\" Id. Success is measured not only by the amount of the recovery but also in terms of \"the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed and the public purpose the plaintiff's litigation served.\" Morales v. City of San Rafael, 96 F.3d 359, 363 (9th Cir.1996); see also McCown, 565 F.3d 1097 (\"in determining a reasonable fee award on remand, the district court should consider not only the monetary results but also the significant nonmonetary results [the plaintiff] achieved for himself and other members of society ... The Supreme Court has likewise indicated that when a decision has served the public interest by vindicating important constitutional rights an award of attorney's fees that is disproportionate to the actual damages may be appropriate\").\nThe LRNA argues that \"by succeeding on the central issue presented obtaining a determination that the Settlement Agreement is invalidthey achieved an excellent result which has a substantial and far reaching public benefit. The result achieved is a significant victory for every citizen who depends, socially and financially, on the protection of zoning laws and the City's adherence to the rule of law.\" Mot. at 14, citing Wells Fargo Bank v. Town of Woodside, 33 Cal.3d 379, 386, 189 Cal.Rptr. 41, 657 P.2d 819 (1983) (\"zoning regulations ... reflect the public's interest in controlling development to protect health and safety\"); Golden Gate Water Ski Club v. County of Contra Costa, 165 Cal.App.4th 249, 259, 80 Cal.Rptr.3d 876 (2008) (\"In the field of zoning laws, [the courts] are dealing with a vital public interest-not one that is strictly between the municipality and the individual litigant. All the residents of the community have a protectable property and personal interest in maintaining the character of the area as established by comprehensive and carefully considered zoning plans ...\").\nThe City, however, argues that out of nine claims in the LRNA's SAC, the City succeeded on only one claim: the third claim seeking a declaratory judgment that the settlement was void under state law. Opp'n at 13. The City reiterates its argument that this third claim is unrelated to the federal constitutional claims brought by the LRNA, as well as its state statutory and constitutional claims. Opp'n at 13. Specifically, the City argues that if the LRNA had had to prove a § 1983 violation, it would have had to have proved a higher level of culpability on the part of the city, and that it could not have met this burden.\" Opp'n at 1.[5] Furthermore, the City argues that \"[b]ecause the League's equal protection claim does not involve a suspect classification, the City's conduct `will survive constitutional scrutiny ... as *1132 long as it bears a rational relation to a legitimate state interest.'\" Opp'n at 14, quoting Patel v. Penman, 103 F.3d 868, 875 (9th Cir.1996). The City argues that it is evident that the LRNA pursued these federal claims solely to support its fee request. Opp'n at 14-15.\nIn addition, the City argues that the LRNA has obtained limited success, because \"the decision hardly makes any historical or land mark impact. For one, the ruling does not vindicate any important constitutional right; it is confined to limited issue of state law. Similarly most decisions deemed insuring to the `public benefit' pertain to federal constitutional or statutory rights; this matter does not.\" Opp'n at 15.,\nThe Court, however, finds the City's arguments unpersuasive. As stated elsewhere herein, the federal and state claims herein were derived from the same nucleus of operative facts, and therefore \"the court should not attempt to divide the request for attorney's fees on a claim-by-claim basis.\" See McCown, 565 F.3d 1097. Furthermore, the LRNA succeeded on the central issue presented: obtaining a determination that the Settlement Agreement is invalid. As the LRNA argues, \"[p]laintiffs can not be punished because the Ninth Circuit observed its duty to avoid constitutional questions and decided the case on state law grounds.\" Reply at 16.\n\n2. Lodestar\n\"In the Ninth Circuit, the customary method of determining the permissible amount of attorneys' fees under § 1988 is the `lodestar' method.\" Ballen v. City of Redmond, 466 F.3d 736, 746 (9th Cir.2006). The lodestar method \"multiplies the number of hours the prevailing party reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.\" Id. After making that computation, the Court then assesses \"whether it is necessary to adjust the presumptively reasonable lode-star figure on the basis of twelve factors.\" Id. The twelve factors are:\n(1) the time and labor required, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case, (5) the customary fee, (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent, (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, (8) the amount involved and the results obtained, (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys, (10) the `undesirability' of the case, (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, and (12) awards in similar cases.\nId. However, only in rare instances should the lodestar figure be adjusted on the basis of these considerations. Harris v. Marhoefer, 24 F.3d 16, 18 (9th Cir.1994).\nThe LRNA argues that its request for $352,011.40. is adequately supported. The most significant portion of the fees requested are for Leslie M. Werlin (\"Werlin\"), a civil litigator who has been in practice in Los Angeles since 1976 (589.65 hours at an hourly rate of $365), and Professor Marci A. Hamilton (\"Professor Hamilton\"), a member of the Pennsylvania bar admitted in 1990 and a law professor (98 hours at an hourly rate of $500). Furthermore, the LRNA requests fees for the work done by the following attorneys: David B. Van Etten (29.56 hours at an hourly rate of $350); Mitchell F. Ducey (136.61 hours at an hourly rate of $230); Amber Y. Sakai (12.1 hours at an hourly rate of $125); Deborah F. Birndorf (7.2 hours at an hourly rate of $240); Marc Paul Jacobs (2 hours at an hourly rate of $285); Sidney K. Kanazawa (.5 hours at an hourly rate of $300); Keith A. Sipprelle (.65 hours at an hourly rate of $280); Herbert M. Weiser (1.5 hours at an hourly *1133 rate of $250); Reen Furutani (Yuba) (.5 hours at an hourly rate of $150); Cris Armenta (9.5 hours at an hourly rate of $250); and Joan A. Wolff (3.5 hours at an hourly rate of $370). In addition, the LRNA seeks fees for the work of legal assistant Jeremy D. Krant (10.7 at an hourly rate of $115) and paralegal Glen A. Davis (.8 hours at an hourly rate of $145). The LRNA also seeks fees for the work of Darrel Menthe (13.7 hours at an hourly rate of $435) and Werlin (33 hours at an hourly rate of $365) in preparing the instant motion and reply, and for appearing at the June 15, 2009 hearing.\nThe LRNA argues that the Ninth Circuit has already necessarily found the rates of Werlin, Hamilton, and Davis to be reasonable, because such rates were used in the calculation of the appellate attorneys' fees award, and their reasonableness is therefore the law of the case. Mot. at 16, n. 7. In addition, the LRNA submits a certified copy of the declaration of David Roberts (\"Roberts\"), a certified public accountant who published a survey of law firm compensation and benefits, which was submitted in Streisand v. Adelman, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. SC0772. Roberts Decl. ¶ 1, 3. Roberts states that at a law firm composed of 76 or more attorneys located in Southern California \"the average billing rate for; (a) an equity partner is $400; (b) a non-equity partner is $259; (c) a fourth year associate is $224; (d) a third year associate is $212; and (e) a second year summer associate is $138. The average billing rate for a legal assistant (exempt for overtime) with 11 to 20 years experience is $128 in the Century City/Beverly Hills area.\" Roberts Decl. ¶ 8.\nThe LRNA also seeks $18,266.35 in expenses, including photocopying, facsimile, transcripts, legal research, parking, filing fees, messenger services, mileage, postage, delivery, telephone, and Professor Hamilton's travel expenses. Werlin Decl. at 10; see Dang v.Cross, 422 F.3d 800, 814 (9th Cir.2005) (\"[u]nder § 1988, the prevailing party may recover as part of the award of attorney's fees those out-of-pocket expenses that `would normally be charged to a fee paying client'\").\nThe City argues that the LRNA's fee request is excessive, because the LRNA incurred many fees on the federal constitutional and statutory claims, the continued pursuit of which \"became unnecessary early in the lawsuit.\" Opp'n at 16. The LRNA counters that \"[t]he relevant issue... is not whether hindsight vindicates an attorney's time expenditures, but whether, at the time the work was performed, a reasonable attorney would have engaged in similar time expenditures.\" Reply at 17, quoting Grant v. Martinez, 973 F.2d 96, 99 (2d Cir.1992).\nThe City further argues that the following aspects of the fee request are excessive: (a) the number of attorneys working on the case; (b) legal research in the amount of $5,743.95, where there is no breakdown as the issues researched; (c) the 98 hours billed by Professor Hamilton (arguing that it was unnecessary to have a constitutional law professor work on the relatively simple and narrow state law issue); and (d) Professor Hamilton's $3,931.35 in travel expenses. Opp'n at 16-17. The LRNA counters that Professor Hamilton worked on the federal constitutional issues, and appeared at hearings where all claims were at issue. Reply at 18-19. The LRNA further argues that prior to March 2004, there was no focus on state law issued in this case, and that state law issues did not come to the forefront until Trancas was decided in 2006. Reply at 19.\nThe Court finds the hourly rates charged by the attorneys in this action and the total number of hours expended on the *1134 litigation to be reasonable and adequately supported by the accompanying evidence. The City presents only conclusory arguments, which do not provide any basis for determining that the LRNA should not be granted the full amount requested.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS LRNA's motion for award of attorneys' fees. The Court hereby awards $352,011.40 in fees to the LRNA.\nIT IS SO ORDERED\nNOTES\n[1]  On May 28, 2008, the Congregation filed a new application for a CUP with the City. On May 5, 2009, the Court dismissed the Congregation Etz Chaim action without prejudice on the ground that it was not prudentially ripe.\n[2]  The LRNA acknowledges that this Court dismissed LRNA's § 1983 claim at the pleadings stage, but argues that this does not mean that the claim was insubstantial for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction. Mot. at 10, citing Mackey v. Pioneer Nat. Bank, 867 F.2d 520, 523 (9th Cir.1989) (\"the ultimate lack of merit of the federal claim does not mean that the claim was insubstantial for purposes of conferring jurisdiction\").\n[3]  The LRNA also argues that the City has failed to demonstrate it acted in good faith, given its decision to enter into the Settlement Agreement was made in City Council proceedings closed to the public. Reply at 7.\n[4]  The LRNA also argues that the City's argument regarding causation are irrelevant, because the required causal connection for an award of attorneys' fees is that actual relief on the merits materially alter the relationship between the parties. See Bennett v. Yoshina, 259 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.2001) (\"to qualify as a `prevailing party' under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 a party must obtain a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties\").\n[5]  To support this argument, the City cites Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass'n v. City of Simi Valley, 882 F.2d 1398, 1407 (9th Cir.1989) (overruled on other grounds by Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir.1996)) (\"To establish a violation of substantive due process, the plaintiffs must prove that the government's action was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare ...\"). However, the LRNA notes that it asserted a procedural due process claim, not a substantive due process claim. Reply at 15.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The effects of Ca(2+)-free perfusion and the calcium paradox on [125I] endothelin-1 binding to rat cardiac membranes.\nThe binding characteristics of [125I]endothelin-1 (ET-1) to cardiac membranes isolated from rat hearts subjected to Ca(2+)-free perfusion or the Ca2+ paradox were examined. The effect of treatment with 2, 3 butanedione monoxime (BDM), which inhibits the tissue damage associated with the calcium paradox, was also investigated. Membranes from rat hearts perfused under control conditions bound [125I]ET-1 to a single population of sites with a Bmax of 107.7 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg protein and an affinity (KD) of 153 +/- 12 pM. Ten minutes of Ca(2+)-free perfusion resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) increase in Bmax to 167.5 +/- 8.3 fmol/mg protein without change in KD. Ca2+ repletion following Ca(2+)-free perfusion tended to increase further the Bmax (180.6 +/- 10.4 fmol/mg protein) without change in KD. Treatment with BDM attenuated but did not prevent the rise in Bmax following Ca(2+)-free perfusion. Following Ca2+ repletion, however, Bmax returned to control levels in the BDM treated group. These changes were not associated with changes in the ability of ET-1 and ET-3 to inhibit [125I]ET-1 binding. The results demonstrate that Ca(2+)-free perfusion is associated with an increase in the binding site density of [125I]ET-1 which is maintained or further increased upon Ca2+ repletion. If, however, the tissue damage associated with the Ca2+ paradox is prevented with BDM, Ca2+ repletion is associated with a reversal of the increase due to Ca(2+)-free perfusion.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "A lot of things about Oregon’s mascot are cool. For one thing, he is a duck, which is cool. He rides a motorcycle. Also cool: his giant, beady eyes that never close and his beak that’s always open like he’s about to say something, though he never will.\n\nHe looks like Donald Duck, and that not being a coincidence makes him even cooler. He is the silent king of Eugene, Oregon.\n\nThere’s exactly one thing about Oregon’s duck mascot that could be cooler: His nickname could become his real name. For now, it’s not. That nickname is “Puddles,” which is about the cutest damned name for a water-based animal I’ve ever heard. People around the world college football Twitter call him that regularly.\n\nBut to Oregon, the duck is not Puddles.\n\nSometime in the 1920s, a live duck mascot named Puddles started showing up at Oregon football and basketball games. The duck kept being escorted to games until the 1940s, when, as the school puts it, “repeated complaints from the Humane Society finally sucked the fun out of bringing a live duck to games.”\n\nPuddles lost its capacity as the team’s mascot. But it made a comeback in another incarnation in 1947, when Oregon’s athletic director struck what the school calls a “handshake agreement” with Walt Disney. The deal was that Donald Duck’s likeness could be the basis for an actual, costumed mascot. So, he is.\n\nDisney and Oregon didn’t put pen to paper on the arrangement until 1973. And by that point, the mascot duck wasn’t Puddles any more. He either didn’t have a distinct name, or he was referred to as “Donald.” That is where our great American confusion begins.\n\nOregon usually refers to the mascot as only “The Duck.”\n\nThe school has been insistent that the mascot’s name is not Puddles. This position was perhaps most explicitly staked out in 2015, though it’s not like it was new news then.\n\n\"The Duck is The Duck,” Oregon assistant AD for communications Andy McNamara told ESPN. “Puddles was the name of a live duck the student body paraded around in the early 20th century.\"\n\nBut the plot always thickens.\n\nIn March 2017, Oregon’s men’s basketball team took to the floor in warmup shooting shirts that referred to The Duck as Puddles, and the official athletics account shared them.\n\nThat’s the Oregon Duck and Benny Beaver, the mascot of rival Oregon State. But when I asked an Oregon official if the move signaled a pro-Puddles shift within Oregon’s administration, I was told that the mascot remained known as The Duck. It seems possible someone at Nike, Oregon’s synonymous apparel provider, went rogue.\n\nThe university’s official stance remains that Puddles is a thing of the past. Oregon’s live duck mascot was Puddles, but its costumed duck mascot is The Duck.\n\nThere are still other traces of Puddles on official channels.\n\nOregon’s official team shop sells a hat called “Zephyr Oregon Ducks Puddles Custom Washed Adjustable Hat - Green.” There’s no rainwater puddle here, either:\n\nA similar item, also with Puddles’ name on it, is available in camouflage.\n\nIf you’re an internet sleuth daring to prove that The Duck’s proper name is actually Puddles, you could choose to treat this as a birth certificate of sorts. But that’s not right, because retailers and apparel-makers have a lot to do with the operation of most team shops. Oregon’s one of many entities that works with the online shop Fanatics. Oregon might not have made a choice here.\n\nPuddles does live elsewhere. A 2011 blog post on the athletic department’s official site refers to “Puddles the Duck” making a guest appearance with UO cheerleaders at a kids fun day. There are, for sure, people associated with the Oregon athletic department who believe Puddles is at least an acceptable nickname for The Duck.\n\nStill, the company line has long been clear.\n\nIs The Duck really Puddles, then? Yes and no.\n\nThis is a paradox. A real Schrödinger's duck situation, if you will.\n\nOregon is resistant to the idea that the duck’s name is Puddles, but it’s not like the school publicly hates the name Puddles. Meanwhile, some of its official partners have paid heed to the name, even if they did it unintentionally or without UO’s blessing.\n\nMany Oregon fans are quick to correct anyone who refers to The Duck as Puddles, but some don’t mind it, and some like both names.\n\n“During my first years at the University of Oregon, I called the mascot Puddles,” says Sean Larson, the managing editor of Oregon blog Addicted to Quack. “Lately, I've been calling it The Duck. I think the way to look at it is that The Duck is its official name, while Puddles is a fun nickname. I personally like the name Puddles better, for what it's worth. I have no issue when people call the mascot Puddles, so long as they know the story behind that name.”\n\n“Oregon’s mascot is The Duck, but if you want to call the mascot Puddles, that’s cool, as it probably means you have some sort of degree of affection for both history and the work of The Duck itself,” agrees Oregon alum Dan Rubenstein of the Solid Verbal podcast. “If you genuinely take exception to people using a fun nickname for a fun mascot, I’m going to guess that you’re not that much fun yourself, so you just matter less and aren't worth worrying about.”\n\nThe Duck is a child of the university, and parents get to name their children.\n\nBut The Duck is also generations old at this point, so he’s old enough to go by Puddles, Donald, or whatever name he wants. We could ask The Duck for his view, but he’d never answer anyway.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Such problems occur in natural language (Which translation is best?), search (What result is best?), and detection (Who is that?) tasks. Almost all machine learning algorithms (with the exception of decision trees) have running times for multiclass classification which are $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ with a canonical example being one-against-all classifiers [@Rifkin2004].\n\nIn this setting, the most efficient possible accurate approach is given by information theory [@CnT]. In essence, any multiclass classification algorithm must uniquely specify the bits of all labels that it predicts correctly on. Consequently, Kraft’s inequality ([@CnT] equation 5.6) implies that the expected *computational* complexity of predicting correctly is $\\Omega(H(Y))$ per example where $H(Y)$ is the Shannon entropy of the label. For the worst case distribution on $k$ classes, this implies $\\Omega(\\log(k))$ computation is required.\n\nHence, our goal is achieving $O(\\log(k))$ computational time per example[^1] for both training and testing, while effectively using online learning algorithms to minimize passes over the data.\n\nThe goal of logarithmic (in $k$) complexity naturally motivates approaches that construct a logarithmic depth hierarchy over the labels, with one label per leaf. While this hierarchy is sometimes available through prior knowledge, in many scenarios it needs to be learned as well. This naturally leads to a *partition* problem which arises at each node in the hierarchy. The partition problem is finding a classifier: $c:X \\rightarrow \\{-1,1\\}$ which divides examples into two subsets with a purer set of labels than the original set. Definitions of purity vary, but canonical examples are the number of labels remaining in each subset, or softer notions such as the average Shannon entropy of the class labels. Despite resulting in a classifier, this problem is fundamentally different from standard binary classification. To see this, note that replacing $c(x)$ with $-c(x)$ is very bad for binary classification, but has no impact on the quality of a partition[^2]. The partition problem is fundamentally non-convex for symmetric classes since the average $\\frac{c(x) -\n  c(x)}{2}$ of $c(x)$ and $-c(x)$ is a poor partition (the always-$0$ function places all points on the same side).\n\nThe choice of partition matters in problem dependent ways. For example, consider examples on a line with label $i$ at position $i$ and threshold classifiers. In this case, trying to partition class labels $\\{1,3\\}$ from class label $2$ results in poor performance.\n\nThe partition problem is typically solved for decision tree learning via an enumerate-and-test approach amongst a small set of possible classifiers (see e.g. [@ig]). In the multiclass setting, it is desirable to achieve substantial error reduction for each node in the tree which motivates using a richer set of classifiers in the nodes to minimize the number of nodes, and thereby decrease the computational complexity. The main theoretical contribution of this work is to establish a boosting algorithm for learning trees with $O(k)$ nodes and $O(\\log k)$ depth, thereby addressing the goal of logarithmic time train and test complexity. Our main theoretical result, presented in Section \\[sec:boosting\\], generalizes a binary boosting-by-decision-tree theorem [@Kearns95] to multiclass boosting. As in all boosting results, performance is critically dependent on the quality of the *weak learner*, supporting intuition that we need sufficiently rich partitioners at nodes. The approach uses a new objective for decision tree learning, which we optimize at each node of the tree. The objective and its theoretical properties are presented in Section \\[sec:framework\\].\n\n[l]{}[0.5]{}\n\nA complete system with multiple partitions could be constructed top down (as the boosting theorem) or bottom up (as Filter tree [@BeygelzimerLR09]). A bottom up partition process appears impossible with representational constraints as shown in Section \\[sec:bottom-up\\] in the Supplementary material so we focus on top-down tree creation.\n\nWhenever there are representational constraints on partitions (such as linear classifiers), finding a strong partition function requires an efficient search over this set of classifiers. Efficient searches over large function classes are routinely performed via gradient descent techniques for supervised learning, so they seem like a natural candidate. In existing literature, examples for doing this exist when the problem is indeed binary, or when there is a prespecified hierarchy over the labels and we just need to find partitioners aligned with that hierarchy. Neither of these cases applies—we have multiple labels and want to dynamically create the choice of partition, rather than assuming that one was handed to us. Does there exist a purity criterion amenable to a gradient descent approach? The precise objective studied in theory fails this test due to its discrete nature, and even natural approximations are challenging to tractably optimize under computational constraints. As a result, we use the theoretical objective as a motivation and construct a new Logarithmic Online Multiclass Tree (LOMtree) algorithm for empirical evaluation.\n\nCreating a tree in an online fashion creates a new class of problems. What if some node is initially created but eventually proves useless because no examples go to it? At best this results in a wasteful solution, while in practice it starves other parts of the tree which need representational complexity. To deal with this, we design an efficient process for recycling orphan nodes into locations where they are needed, and prove that the number of times a node is recycled is at most logarithmic in the number of examples. The algorithm is described in Section \\[sec:alg\\] and analyzed in Section \\[sec:swap-bound\\].\n\nAnd is it effective? Given the inherent non-convexity of the partition problem this is unavoidably an empirical question which we answer on a range of datasets varying from 26 to 105K classes in Section \\[sec:experiments\\]. We find that under constrained training times, this approach is quite effective compared to all baselines while dominating other $O(\\log k)$ train time approaches.\n\nWhat’s new? To the best of our knowledge, the splitting criterion, the boosting statement, the LOMtree algorithm, the swapping guarantee, and the experimental results are all new here.\n\nPrior Work\n----------\n\nOnly a few authors address logarithmic time training. The Filter tree [@BeygelzimerLR09] addresses consistent (and robust) multiclass classification, showing that it is possible in the statistical limit. The Filter tree does not address the partition problem as we do here which as shown in our experimental section is often helpful. The partition finding problem is addressed in the conditional probability tree [@BeygelzimerLLSS09], but that paper addresses conditional probability estimation. Conditional probability estimation can be converted into multiclass prediction [@Bishop:2006:PRM:1162264], but doing so is not a logarithmic time operation.\n\nQuite a few authors have addressed logarithmic testing time while allowing training time to be $O(k)$ or worse. While these approaches are intractable on our larger scale problems, we describe them here for context. The partition problem can be addressed by recursively applying spectral clustering on a confusion graph [@BengioWG10] (other clustering approaches include [@journals/informaticaSI/MadzarovGC09]). Empirically, this approach has been found to sometimes lead to badly imbalanced splits [@DengSBL11]. In the context of ranking, another approach uses $k$-means hierarchical clustering to recover the label sets for a given partition [@weston13].\n\nThe more recent work [@conf/cvpr/ZhaoX13] on the multiclass classification problem addresses it via sparse output coding by tuning high-cardinality multiclass categorization into a bit-by-bit decoding problem. The authors decouple the learning processes of coding matrix and bit predictors and use probabilistic decoding to decode the optimal class label. The authors however specify a class similarity which is $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ to compute (see Section $2.1.1$ in [@conf/cvpr/ZhaoX13]), and hence this approach is in a different complexity class than ours (this is also born out experimentally). The variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme for solving multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the assumption of output sparsity was also considered in [@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0902-1284]. Their approach in general requires $O(k)$ running time to decode since, in essence, the fit of each label to the predictions must be checked and there are $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ labels. Another approach [@DBLP:journals/corr/AgarwalKKSV13] proposes iterative least-squares-style algorithms for multi-class (and multi-label) prediction with relatively large number of examples and data dimensions, and the work of [@icml2014c2_beijbom14] focusing in particular on the cost-sensitive multiclass classification. Both approaches however have $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ training time.\n\nDecision trees are naturally structured to allow logarithmic time prediction. Traditional decision trees often have difficulties with a large number of classes because their splitting criteria are not well-suited to the large class setting. However, newer approaches [@Manik; @Prabhu2014] have addressed this effectively at significant scales in the context of multilabel classification (multilabel learning, with missing labels, is also addressed in [@LMLML14]). More specifically, the first work [@Manik] performs brute force optimization of a multilabel variant of the Gini index defined over the set of positive labels in the node and assumes label independence during random forest construction. Their method makes fast predictions, however has high training costs [@Prabhu2014]. The second work [@Prabhu2014] optimizes a rank sensitive loss function (Discounted Cumulative Gain). Additionally, a well-known problem with hierarchical classification is that the performance significantly deteriorates lower in the hierarchy [@LiuLargeScale2005] which some authors solve by biasing the training distribution to reduce error propagation while simultaneously combining bottom-up and top-down approaches during training [@conf/sigir/BennettN09].\n\nThe reduction approach we use for optimizing partitions implicitly optimizes a differential objective. A non-reductive approach to this has been tried previously [@MTSWIMC] on other objectives yielding good results in a different context.\n\nFramework and theoretical analysis {#sec:framework}\n==================================\n\nIn this section we describe the essential elements of the approach, and outline the theoretical properties of the resulting framework. We begin with high-level ideas.\n\nSetting {#sec:outline}\n-------\n\nWe employ a hierarchical approach for learning a multiclass decision tree structure, training this structure in a *top-down* fashion. We assume that we receive examples $x \\in {\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{X}}}\\subseteq\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{R}}}^d$, with labels $y \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots, k\\}$. We also assume access to a hypothesis class ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{H}}}$ where each $h \\in {\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{H}}}$ is a binary classifier, $h~:~{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{X}}}\\mapsto \\{-1, 1\\}$. The overall objective is to learn a tree of depth $O(\\log k)$, where each node in the tree consists of a classifier from ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{H}}}$. The classifiers are trained in such a way that $h_n(x) = 1$ ($h_n$ denotes the classifier in node $n$ of the tree[^3]) means that the example $x$ is sent to the right subtree of node $n$, while $h_n(x) = -1$ sends $x$ to the left subtree. When we reach a leaf, we predict according to the label with the highest frequency amongst the examples reaching that leaf.\n\nIn the interest of computational complexity, we want to encourage the number of examples going to the left and right to be *fairly balanced*. For good statistical accuracy, we want to send examples of class $i$ almost exclusively to either the left or the right subtree, thereby refining the *purity* of the class distributions at subsequent levels in the tree. The *purity* of a tree node is therefore a measure of whether the examples of each class reaching the node are then mostly sent to its one child node (pure split) or otherwise to both children (impure split). The formal definitions of *balancedness* and *purity* are introduced in Section \\[sec:objective\\]. An objective expressing both criteria[^4] and resulting theoretical properties are illustrated in the following sections. A key consideration in picking this objective is that we want to effectively optimize it over hypotheses $h \\in {\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{H}}}$, while streaming over examples in an online fashion[^5]. This seems unsuitable with some of the more standard decision tree objectives such as Shannon or Gini entropy, which leads us to design a new objective. At the same time, we show in Section \\[sec:boosting\\] that under suitable assumptions, optimizing the objective also leads to effective reduction of the average Shannon entropy over the entire tree.\n\nAn objective and analysis of resulting partitions {#sec:objective}\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWe now define a criterion to measure the quality of a hypothesis $h \\in {\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{H}}}$ in creating partitions at a fixed node $n$ in the tree. Let $\\pi_i$ denotes the proportion of label $i$ amongst the examples reaching this node. Let $P(h(x) > 0)$ and $P(h(x)\n> 0 | i)$ denote the fraction of examples reaching $n$ for which $h(x)\n> 0$, marginally and conditional on class $i$ respectively. Then we define the objective[^6]: $$J(h) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^k \\pi_i \\left| P(h(x) > 0) - P(h(x) > 0 | i)\n  \\right|.\n  \\label{eqn:objective}\n\\vspace{-0.03in}$$ We aim to *maximize the objective $J(h)$* to obtain high quality partitions. Intuitively, the objective encourages the fraction of examples going to the right from class $i$ to be substantially different from the background fraction for each class $i$. As a concrete simple scenario, if $P(h(x) > 0) = 0.5$ for some hypothesis $h$, then the objective prefers $P(h(x) > 0 | i)$ to be as close to 0 or 1 as possible for each class $i$, leading to pure partitions. We now make these intuitions more formal.\n\nThe hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ induces a pure split if $$\\alpha := \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\min(P(h(x) > 0|i), P(h(x)<0|i)) \\leq\n\\delta, \n\\vspace{-0.04in}$$ where $\\delta \\in [0,0.5)$, and $\\alpha$ is called the *purity factor*.\n\nIn particular, a partition is called *maximally pure* if $\\alpha\n= 0$, meaning that each class is sent exclusively to the left or the right. We now define a similar definition for the balancedness of a split.\n\nThe hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ induces a balanced split if $$c \\leq \\underbrace{P(h(x) > 0)}_{=\\beta} \\leq 1 - c,\n\\vspace{-0.06in}$$ where $c \\in (0,0.5]$, and $\\beta$ is called the *balancing factor*.\n\nA partition is called *maximally balanced* if $\\beta = 0.5$, meaning that an equal number of examples are sent to the left and right children of the partition. The balancing factor and the purity factor are related as shown in Lemma \\[lemma:obj-to-purity\\] (the proofs of Lemma \\[lemma:obj-to-purity\\] and the following lemma (Lemma \\[lemma:maximal\\]) are deferred to the Supplementary material).\n\nFor any hypothesis $h$, and any distribution over examples $(x,y)$, the purity factor $\\alpha$ and the balancing factor $\\beta$ satisfy $\\alpha \\leq \\min\\{(2 - J(h))/(4\\beta) - \\beta, 0.5\\}$. \\[lemma:obj-to-purity\\]\n\nA partition is called *maximally pure and balanced* if it satisfies both $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\beta = 0.5$. We see that $J(h) = 1$ for a hypothesis $h$ inducing a maximally pure and balanced partition as captured in the next lemma. Of course we do not expect to have hypotheses producing maximally pure and balanced splits in practice.\n\nFor any hypothesis $h~:~{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{X}}}\\mapsto \\{-1,1\\}$, the objective $J(h)$ satisfies $J(h) \\in\n  [0,1]$. Furthermore, if $h$ induces a maximally pure and balanced partition then $J(h) = 1$. \\[lemma:maximal\\]\n\nQuality of the entire tree {#sec:boosting}\n--------------------------\n\nThe above section helps us understand the quality of an individual split produced by effectively maximizing $J(h)$. We next reason about the quality of the entire tree as we add more and more nodes. We measure the quality of trees using the average entropy over all the leaves in the tree, and track the decrease of this entropy as a function of the number of nodes. Our analysis extends the theoretical analysis in [@Kearns95], originally developed to show the boosting properties of the decision trees for binary classification problems, to the multiclass classification setting.\n\nGiven a tree $\\mathcal{T}$, we consider the entropy function $G_t$ as the measure of the quality of tree: $$G_t = \\sum_{l \\in \\mathcal{L}}w_l\\sum_{i = 1}^k \\pi_{l,i}\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi_{l,i}} \\right)\n\\vspace{-0.05in}$$ where $\\pi_{l,i}$’s are the probabilities that a randomly chosen data point $x$ drawn from $\\mathcal{P}$, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is a fixed target distribution over $\\mathcal{X}$, has label $i$ given that $x$ reaches node $l$, $\\mathcal{L}$ denotes the set of all tree leaves, $t$ denotes the number of internal tree nodes, and $w_l$ is the weight of leaf $l$ defined as the probability a randomly chosen $x$ drawn from $\\mathcal{P}$ reaches leaf $l$ (note that $\\sum_{l \\in\n  \\mathcal{L}}w_l = 1$).\n\nWe next state the main theoretical result of this paper (it is captured in Theorem \\[thm:main\\]). We adopt the *weak learning* framework. The *weak hypothesis assumption*, captured in Definition \\[def:wha\\], posits that each node of the tree $\\mathcal{T}$ has a hypothesis $h$ in its hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ which guarantees simultaneously a “weak” purity and a ”weak” balancedness of the split on any distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ over $\\mathcal{X}$. Under this assumption, one can use the new decision tree approach to drive the error below any threshold.\n\nLet $m$ denote any node of the tree $\\mathcal{T}$, and let $\\beta_m = P(h_m(x) > 0)$ and $P_{m,i} = P(h_m(x) > 0|i)$. Furthermore, let $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ be such that for all $m$, $\\gamma \\in (0,\\min(\\beta_m,1-\\beta_m)]$. We say that the *weak hypothesis assumption* is satisfied when for any distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ over $\\mathcal{X}$ at each node $m$ of the tree $\\mathcal{T}$ there exists a hypothesis $h_m \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $J(h_m)/2 =\n\\sum_{i = 1}^k \\pi_{m,i}|P_{m,i} - \\beta_{m}| \\geq \\gamma$. \\[def:wha\\]\n\nUnder the Weak Hypothesis Assumption, for any $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, to obtain $G_t \\leq \\alpha$ it suffices to make $t \\geq (1/\\alpha)^\\frac{4(1 - \\gamma)^2\\ln\n  k}{\\gamma^2}$ splits. \\[thm:main\\]\n\nWe defer the proof of Theorem \\[thm:main\\] to the Supplementary material and provide its sketch now. The analysis studies a tree construction algorithm where we recursively find the leaf node with the highest weight, and choose to split it into two children. Let $n$ be the heaviest leaf at time $t$. Consider splitting it to two children. The contribution of node $n$ to the tree entropy changes after it splits. This change (entropy reduction) corresponds to a gap in the Jensen’s inequality applied to the concave function, and thus can further be lower-bounded (we use the fact that Shannon entropy is strongly concave with respect to $\\ell_1$-norm (see e.g., Example 2.5 in Shalev-Shwartz [@ShaiSS2012])). The obtained lower-bound turns out to depend proportionally on $J(h_n)^2$. This implies that the larger the objective $J(h_n)$ is at time $t$, the larger the entropy reduction ends up being, which further reinforces intuitions to maximize $J$. In general, it might not be possible to find any hypothesis with a large enough objective $J(h_n)$ to guarantee sufficient progress at this point so we appeal to a *weak learning assumption*. This assumption can be used to further lower-bound the entropy reduction and prove Theorem \\[thm:main\\].\n\nThe LOMtree Algorithm {#sec:alg}\n=====================\n\n  **Input**: regression algorithm $R$, max number of tree non-leaf nodes $T$, swap resistance $R_S\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:$\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Subroutine **SetNode ($v$)**\n  ${\\bm m}_v = \\emptyset $(${\\bm m}_v(y)$ - sum of the scores for class $y$)\n  ${\\bm l}_v \\:\\:= \\emptyset $ (${\\bm l}_v(y)$ - number of points of class $y$ reaching $v$)\n  ${\\bm n}_v \\:= \\emptyset $ (${\\bm n}_v(y)$ - number of points of class $y$ which are used to train regressor in $v$)\n  ${\\bm e}_v \\:\\:\\!= \\emptyset $ (${\\bm e}_v(y)$ - expected score for class $y$)\n  $\\:\\:\\!\\!{\\bm E}_v \\:\\!\\:\\!= 0 $ (expected total score)\n  $C_v \\:\\:\\!\\!= 0$(the size of the smallest leafin the subtree with root $v$)\n  Subroutine **UpdateC** ($v$)\n  **While** ($v \\neq r$ AND $C_{\\textsc{parent}(v)} \\neq C_v$)\n  $v = \\textsc{parent}(v)$; $C_v = \\min(C_{\\textsc{left}(v)},C_{\\textsc{right}(v)})$\n  Subroutine **Swap** (v)\n  Find a leaf $s$ for which $(C_s = C_r)$\n  $s_{\\textsc{pa}} \\!\\!=\\!\\! \\textsc{parent}(s)$; $s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$ = <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">grandpa</span>(s); $s_{\\textsc{sib}} \\!\\!=\\!\\! \\textsc{sibling}(s)$\n  **If** ($s_{\\textsc{pa}}$ = <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">left</span>($s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$)) <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">left</span>($s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$) = $s_{\\textsc{sib}}$**Else** <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">right</span>($s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$) = $s_{\\textsc{sib}}$\n  **UpdateC** ($s_{\\textsc{sib}}$); **SetNode** ($s$); $\\textsc{left}(v) = s$; **SetNode** ($s_{\\textsc{pa}}$); $\\textsc{right}(v) = s_{\\textsc{pa}}$\n  **Create** root $r = 0$: **SetNode** ($r$); $t = 1$\n  **For each** example $(\\bm{x},y)$ **do**\n  Set $j = r$\n  **Do**\n  **If** ($l_j(y) = \\emptyset$)\n  $m_j(y) = 0$; $l_j(y) = 0$;$n_j(y) = 0$;$e_j(y) = 0$\n  $\\bm{l}_j(y)$++\n  **If**($j$ is a leaf)\n  **If**(${\\bm l}_j$ has at least $2$ non-zero entries)\n  **If**($t \\!\\!<\\!\\!

Note that Equation \\[eqn:objective\\] can be written (details are shown in Section \\[sec:explanation\\] in the Supplementary material) as $$J(h) = 2\\mathbb{E}_i [|\\mathbb{E}_x[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0|i)]|].\n\\vspace{-0.05in}$$ Maximizing this objective is a discrete optimization problem that can be relaxed as follows $$J(h) = 2\\mathbb{E}_i[|\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[h(x)|i]|],\n\\vspace{-0.05in}$$ where $E_{x}[h(x)|i]$ is the expected score of class i.\n\nWe next explain our empirical approach for maximizing the relaxed objective. The empirical estimates of the expectations can be easily stored and updated online in every tree node. The decision whether to send an example reaching a node to its left or right child node is based on the sign of the difference between the two expectations: $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)]$ and $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[h(x)|y]$, where $y$ is a label of the data point, i.e. when $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[h(x)|y] > 0$ the data point is sent to the left, else it is sent to the right. This procedure is conveniently demonstrated on a toy example in Section \\[sec:toy\\] in the Supplement.\n\nDuring training, the algorithm assigns a unique label to each node of the tree which is currently a leaf. This is the label with the highest frequency amongst the examples reaching that leaf. While testing, a test example is pushed down the tree along the path from the root to the leaf, where in each non-leaf node of the path its regressor directs the example either to the left or right child node. The test example is then labeled with the label assigned to the leaf that this example descended to.\n\nThe training algorithm is detailed in Algorithm \\[alg:OTT\\] where each tree node contains a classifier (we use linear classifiers), i.e. $h_j$ is the regressor stored in node $j$ and $h_j(\\bf x)$ is the value of the prediction of $h_j$ on example $\\bf x$. The stopping criterion for expanding the tree is when the number of non-leaf nodes reaches a threshold $T$.\n\nSwapping {#sec:swap-bound}\n--------\n\nchild [node [$\\dots$]{} child [node [$j$]{}]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} ]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{} child [node […]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{pa}}$]{} child [node [$s$]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{sib}}$]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} ]{} ]{} ]{} ]{};\n\nchild [node [$\\dots$]{} child [node [$j$]{} child [node [$s$]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{pa}}$]{}]{} ]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} ]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{} child [node […]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{gpa}}$]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} child [node [$s_{\\textsc{sib}}$]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} child [node [$\\dots$]{}]{} ]{} ]{} ]{};\n\n\\[fig:swap\\]\n\nConsider a scenario where the current training example descends to leaf $j$. The leaf can split (create two children) if the examples that reached it in the past were coming from at least two different classes. However, if the number of non-leaf nodes of the tree reaches threshold $T$, no more nodes can be expanded and thus $j$ cannot create children. Since the tree construction is done online, some nodes created at early stages of training may end up useless because no examples reach them later on. This prevents potentially useful splits such as at leaf $j$. This problem can be solved by recycling orphan nodes (subroutine **Swap** in Algorithm \\[alg:OTT\\]). The general idea behind node recycling is to allow nodes to split if a certain condition is met. In particular, node $j$ splits if the following holds: $$C_j - \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}}{\\bm l}_j(i) > R_S(C_r+1),\n\\label{eq:swap_cond}\n\\vspace{-0.02in}$$ where $r$ denotes the root of the entire tree, $C_j$ is the size of the smallest leaf in the subtree with root $j$, where the smallest leaf is the one with the smallest total number of data points reaching it in the past, ${\\bm l}_j$ is a $k$-dimensional vector of non-negative integers where the $i^{\\text{th}}$ element is the count of the number of data points with label $i$ reaching leaf $j$ in the past, and finally $R_S$ is a “swap resistance”. The subtraction of $\\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}}{\\bm l}_j(i)$ in Equation \\[eq:swap\\_cond\\] ensures that a pure node will not be recycled.\n\nIf the condition in Inequality \\[eq:swap\\_cond\\] is satisfied, the swap of the nodes is performed where an orphan leaf $s$, which was reached by the smallest number of examples in the past, and its parent $s_{\\textsc{PA}}$ are detached from the tree and become children of node $j$ whereas the old sibling $s_{\\textsc{sib}}$ of an orphan node $s$ becomes a direct child of the old grandparent $s_{\\textsc{GPA}}$. The swapping procedure is shown in Figure 2. The condition captured in the Inequality \\[eq:swap\\_cond\\] allows us to prove that the number of times any given node is recycled is upper-bounded by the logarithm of the number of examples whenever the swap resistance is $4$ or more (Lemma \\[lemma:sb\\]).\n\nLet the swap resistance $R_S$ be greater or equal to $4$. Then for all sequences of examples, the number of times Algorithm \\[alg:OTT\\] recycles any given node is upper-bounded by the logarithm (with base $2$) of the sequence length. \\[lemma:sb\\]\n\nExperiments {#sec:experiments}\n===========\n\nWe address several hypotheses experimentally.\n\n1.  The LOMtree algorithm achieves true logarithmic time computation in practice.\n\n2.  The LOMtree algorithm is competitive with or better than all other logarithmic train/test time algorithms for multiclass classification.\n\n3.  The LOMtree algorithm has statistical performance close to more common $O(k)$ approaches.\n\n[l]{}[0.6]{}\n\n      Isolet   Sector   Aloi    ImNet        ODP\n  -- -------- -------- ------ ---------- -----------\n       52.3      19     17.7     104          3\n       617       54     128      6144        0.5\n       7797     9619    108      14.2      1577418\n        26      105     1000   $\\sim$22   $\\sim$105\n\n\\[tab:dsize\\]\n\nTo address these hypotheses, we conducted experiments on a variety of benchmark multiclass datasets: *Isolet*, *Sector*, *Aloi*, *ImageNet* (*ImNet*) and *ODP*. The details of the datasets are provided in Table \\[tab:dsize\\]. The datasets were divided into training ($90\\%$) and testing ($10\\%$). Furthermore, $10\\%$ of the training dataset was used as a validation set.\n\nThe baselines we compared *LOMtree* with are a balanced random tree of logarithmic depth (*Rtree*) and the *Filter tree* [@BeygelzimerLR09]. Where computationally feasible, we also compared with a one-against-all classifier (*OAA*) as a representative $O(k)$ approach. All methods were implemented in the Vowpal Wabbit [@VowpalWabbit] learning system and have similar levels of optimization. The regressors in the tree nodes for *LOMtree*, *Rtree*, and *Filter tree* as well as the *OAA* regressors were trained by online gradient descent for which we explored step sizes chosen from the set $\\{0.25,0.5,0.75,1,2,4,8\\}$. We used linear regressors. For each method we investigated training with up to $20$ passes through the data and we selected the best setting of the parameters (step size and number of passes) as the one minimizing the validation error. Additionally, for the *LOMtree* we investigated different settings of the stopping criterion for the tree expansion: $T = \\{k-1,2k-1,4k-1,8k-1,16k-1,32k-1,64k-1\\}$, and swap resistance $R_S = \\{4,8,16,32,64,128,256\\}$.\n\nIn Table \\[tab:traintime\\] and \\[tab:peretesttime\\] we report respectively train time and per-example test time (the best performer is indicated in bold). Training time (and later reported test error) is not provided for *OAA* on *ImageNet* and *ODP* due to intractability-both are petabyte scale computations.\n\n        Isolet       Sector        Aloi\n  -- ------------ ------------ ------------\n      **16.27s**   **12.77s**   **51.86s**\n        19.58s       18.37s      11m2.43s\n\n  : Per-example test time on all problems.\n\n\\[tab:traintime\\]\n\n        Isolet       Sector        Aloi        ImNet         ODP\n  -- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------\n      **0.14ms**   **0.13ms**   **0.06ms**   **0.52ms**   **0.26ms**\n       0.16 ms       0.24ms       0.33ms       0.21s        1.05s\n\n  : Per-example test time on all problems.\n\n\\[tab:peretesttime\\]\n\nThe first hypothesis is consistent with the experimental results. Time-wise *LOMtree* significantly outperforms *OAA* due to building only close-to logarithmic depth trees. The improvement in the training time increases with the number of classes in the classification problem. For instance on *Aloi* training with *LOMtree* is $12.8$ times faster than with $OAA$. The same can be said about the test time, where the per-example test time for *Aloi*, *ImageNet* and *ODP* are respectively $5.5$, $403.8$ and $4038.5$ times faster than *OAA*. The significant advantage of *LOMtree* over *OAA* is also captured in Figure \\[fig:impex\\].\n\n[l]{}[0.5]{}\n\nNext, in Table \\[tab:testerr\\] (the best logarithmic time performer is indicated in bold) we report test error of logarithmic train/test time algorithms. We also show the binomial symmetrical $95\\%$ confidence intervals for our results. Clearly the second hypothesis is also consistent with the experimental results. Since the *Rtree* imposes a random label partition, the resulting error it obtains is generally worse than the error obtained by the competitor methods including *LOMtree* which learns the label partitioning directly from the data. At the same time *LOMtree* beats *Filter tree* on every dataset, though for *ImageNet* and *ODP* (both have a high level of noise) the advantage of *LOMtree* is not as significant.\n\n       LOMtree      Rtree     Filter tree     OAA\n  -- ----------- ----------- ------------- ---------\n      **6.36**      16.92        15.10      $3.56$\n        16.19     **15.77**      17.70      $9.17$\n      **16.50**     83.74        80.50      $13.78$\n      **90.17**     96.99        92.12        NA\n      **93.46**     93.85        93.76        NA\n\n  : Test error ($\\%$) and confidence interval on all problems.\n\n\\[tab:testerr\\]\n\nThe third hypothesis is weakly consistent with the empirical results. The time advantage of *LOMtree* comes with some loss of statistical accuracy with respect to *OAA* where *OAA* is tractable. We conclude that *LOMtree* significantly closes the gap between other logarithmic time methods and *OAA*, making it a plausible approach in computationally constrained large-$k$ applications.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThe LOMtree algorithm reduces the multiclass problem to a set of binary problems organized in a tree structure where the partition in every tree node is done by optimizing a new partition criterion online. The criterion guarantees pure and balanced splits leading to logarithmic training and testing time for the tree classifier. We provide theoretical justification for our approach via a boosting statement and empirically evaluate it on multiple multiclass datasets. Empirically, we find that this is the best available logarithmic time approach for multiclass classification problems.\n\n### Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments .unnumbered}\n\nWe would like to thank Alekh Agarwal, Dean Foster, Robert Schapire and Matus Telgarsky for valuable discussions.\n\nBottom-up partitions do not work {#sec:bottom-up}\n================================\n\nThe most natural bottom-up construction for creating partitions is not viable as will be now shown by an example. Bottom-up construction techniques start by pairing labels, either randomly or arbitrarily, and then building a predictor of whether the class label is left or right conditioned on the class label being one of the paired labels. In order to construct a full tree, this operation must compose, pairing trees with size $2$ to create trees of size $4$. Here, we show that the straightforward approach to composition fails.\n\nSuppose we have a one dimensional feature space with examples of class label $i$ having feature value $i$ and we work with threshold predictors. Suppose we have 4 classes $1, 2, 3, 4$, and we happen to pair $(1,3)$ and $(2,4)$. It is easy to build a linear predictor for each of these splits. The next step is building a predictor for $(1,3)$ vs $(2,4)$ which is impossible because all thresholds in $(-\\infty,1)$, $(2,3)$, and $(4,\\infty)$ err on two labels while thresholds on $(1,2)$ and $(3,4)$ err on one label.\n\nProof of Lemma \\[lemma:obj-to-purity\\]\n======================================\n\nWe start from deriving an upper-bound on $J(h)$. For the ease of notation let $P_i = P(h(x) > 0 | i)$. Thus $$J(h) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\left \\lvert P(h(x) > 0 | i) - P(h(x) > 0)\\right \\rvert = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\left \\lvert P_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\pi_jP_j\\right \\rvert,$$ where $\\forall_{i = \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}}0 \\leq P_i \\leq 1$. Let $\\alpha_i = \\min(P_i,1-P_i)$ and recall the purity factor $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\alpha_i$ and the balancing factor $\\beta = P(h(x) > 0)$. Without loss of generality let $\\beta \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, let $$L_1 = \\{i:i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}, P_i \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\}, \\:\\:\\:L_2 = \\{i:i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}, P_i \\in [\\beta,\\frac{1}{2})\\}$$ $$\\text{and} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:L_3 = \\{i:i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}, P_i < \\beta\\}.$$ First notice that $$\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_iP_i = \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 - \\alpha_i) + \\sum_{i \\in L_2 \\cup L_3}\\pi_i\\alpha_i = \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i - 2\\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + \\alpha\n\\label{eq:medium}$$ Therefore $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{J(h)}{2} &=& \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\left \\lvert P_i - \\beta \\right \\rvert = \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 - \\alpha_i - \\beta) + \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i(\\alpha_i - \\beta) + \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i(\\beta - \\alpha_i)\\\\\n&=& \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 - \\beta) - \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i - \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\beta + \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i\\beta - \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i\\alpha_i\\end{aligned}$$ Note that $\\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i = 1 - \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i - \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i$ and therefore $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{J(h)}{2} &=& \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 \\!-\\! \\beta) \\!-\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i \\!+\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i \\!-\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\beta + \\beta(1 \\!-\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i \\!-\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i) \\!-\\!\\!\\! \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i\\alpha_i\\\\\n&=& \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 - 2\\beta) - \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + \\beta(1 - 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i) - \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i\\alpha_i\\end{aligned}$$ Furthermore, since $- \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + \\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i - \\sum_{i \\in L_3}\\pi_i\\alpha_i = - \\alpha + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i$ we further write that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{J(h)}{2} &=& \\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i(1 - 2\\beta)+ \\beta(1 - 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i) - \\alpha + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i\\end{aligned}$$ By Equation \\[eq:medium\\], it can be further rewritten as $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{J(h)}{2} &=& (1 - 2\\beta)(\\beta + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i - \\alpha)+ \\beta(1 - 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i) - \\alpha + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i\\alpha_i\\\\\n&=& 2(1 - \\beta)(\\beta - \\alpha) + 2(1 - 2\\beta)\\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i(\\alpha_i - \\beta)\\end{aligned}$$ Since $\\alpha_i$’s are bounded by $0.5$ we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{J(h)}{2} &\\leq& 2(1 - \\beta)(\\beta - \\alpha) + 2(1 - 2\\beta)\\sum_{i \\in L_1}\\pi_i\\alpha_i + 2\\sum_{i \\in L_2}\\pi_i(\\frac{1}{2} - \\beta)\\\\\n&\\leq& 2(1 - \\beta)(\\beta - \\alpha) + 2(1 - 2\\beta)\\alpha + 1 - 2\\beta\\\\\n&=& 2\\beta(1 - \\beta) - 2\\alpha(1 - \\beta) + 2\\alpha(1 - 2\\beta) + 1 - 2\\beta\\\\\n&=& 1 - 2\\beta^2 - 2\\beta\\alpha\\end{aligned}$$ Thus: $$\\alpha \\leq \\frac{2 - J(h)}{4\\beta} - \\beta.$$\n\nProof of Lemma \\[lemma:maximal\\]\n================================\n\nWe first show that $J(h) \\in [0,1]$. We start from deriving an upper-bound on $J(h)$, where $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is some hypothesis in the hypothesis class. For the ease of notation let $P_i = P(h(x) > 0 | i)$. Thus $$\\begin{aligned}\nJ(h) &=& 2\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\left \\lvert P(h(x) > 0 | i) - P(h(x) > 0)\\right \\rvert\\\\\n& = &2\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\pi_i\\left \\lvert P_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\pi_jP_j\\right \\rvert, \\nonumber\n\\label{eq:objform}\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\forall_{i = \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}}0 \\leq P_i \\leq 1$. The objective $J(h)$ is certainly maximized on the extremes of the $[0,1]$ interval. The upper-bound on $J(h)$ can be thus obtained by setting some of the $P_i$’s to $1$’s and remaining ones to $0$’s. To be more precise, let $$L_1 = \\{i:i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}, P_i = 1\\} \\text{\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:and\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:} L_2 = \\{i:i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}, P_i = 0\\}.$$ Therefore it follows that $$\\begin{aligned}\nJ(h) &\\leq& 2\\left[\\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i(1 - \\sum_{j \\in L_1}\\pi_j) + \\sum_{i \\in L_2} \\pi_i\\sum_{j \\in L_1}\\pi_j\\right]\\\\\n&=&  2\\left[\\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i - ( \\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i)^2 + (1 -  \\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i) \\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i\\right]\\\\ \n&=& 4\\left[\\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i - ( \\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i)^2\\right]\\end{aligned}$$\n\nLet $b = \\sum_{i \\in L_1} \\pi_i$ thus $$J(h) \\leq 4b(1 - b) = -4b^2 + 4b\n\\label{eq:upper_bound}$$\n\nSince $b \\in [0,1]$, it is straightforward that $-4b^2 + 4b \\in [0,1]$ and thus $J(h) \\in [0,1]$.\n\nWe now proceed to prove the main statement of Lemma \\[lemma:maximal\\], if $h$ induces a maximally pure and balanced partition then $J(h) = 1$. Since $h$ is maximally balanced, $P(h(x) > 0) = 0.5$. Simultaneously, since $h$ is maximally pure $\\forall_{i = \\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}}(P(h(x) > 0|i) = 0 \\:\\:\\text{or}\\:\\: P(h(x) > 0|i) = 1)$. Substituting that into Equation \\[eq:objform\\] yields that $J(h) = 1$.\n\nProof of Theorem \\[thm:main\\] {#sec:maindetails}\n=============================\n\nThe analysis studies a tree construction algorithm where we recursively find the leaf node with the highest weight, and choose to split it into two children. Consider the tree constructed over $t$ steps where in each step we take one leaf node and split it into two. Let $n$ be the heaviest node at time $t$ and its weight $w_n$ be denoted by $w$ for brevity. Consider splitting this leaf to two children $n_0$ and $n_1$. For the ease of notation let $w_0 = w_{n_0}$ and $w_1 =\nw_{n_1}$. Also for the ease of notation let $\\beta = P(h_n(x) > 0)$ and $P_i = P(h_n(x) > 0|i)$. Let $\\pi_i$ be the shorthand for $\\pi_{n,i}$ and $h$ be the shorthand for $h_n$. Recall that $\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^k\\pi_iP_i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k\\pi_i = 1$. Also notice that $w_0 = w(1-\\beta)$ and $w_1\n= w\\beta$. Let ${\\bm \\pi}$ be the $k$-element vector with $i^{th}$ entry equal to $\\pi_i$. Furthermore let $\\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi}) = \\sum_{i =\n  1}^k \\pi_{i}\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi_{i}} \\right)$.\n\nBefore the split the contribution of node $n$ to $G_t$ was $w\\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi})$. Let $\\pi_{n_0,i} =\n\\frac{\\pi_i(1 - P_i)}{1 - \\beta}$ and $\\pi_{n_1,i} =\n\\frac{\\pi_iP_i}{\\beta}$ be the probabilities that a randomly chosen $x$ drawn from $\\mathcal{P}$ has label $i$ given that $x$ reaches nodes $n_0$ and $n_1$ respectively. For brevity, let $\\pi_{n_0,i}$ be denoted by $\\pi_{0,i}$ and $\\pi_{n_1,i}$ be denoted by $\\pi_{1,i}$. Furthermore let ${\\bm \\pi}_0$ be the $k$-element vector with $i^{th}$ entry equal to $\\pi_{0,i}$ and let ${\\bm \\pi}_1$ be the $k$-element vector with $i^{th}$ entry equal to $\\pi_{1,i}$. Notice that ${\\bm \\pi} = (1 - \\beta){\\bm \\pi}_0 +\n\\beta{\\bm \\pi}_1$. After the split the contribution of the same, now internal, node $n$ changes to $w((1- \\beta)\\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi}_0) + \\beta\n\\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi}_1))$. We denote the difference between them as $\\Delta_t$ and thus $$\\Delta_t := G_t - G_{t+1} = w\\left[\\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi}) - (1- \\beta)\\tilde{G}({\\bm\n    \\pi}_0) - \\beta \\tilde{G}({\\bm \\pi}_1)\\right].\n  \\label{eqn:ent-decrease}\n\\vspace{-0.02in}$$ We aim to lower-bound $\\Delta_t$. The entropy reduction of Equation \\[eqn:ent-decrease\\] [@Kearns95] corresponds to a gap in the Jensen’s inequality applied to the concave function $\\tilde{G}(\\bm\n\\pi)$. This leads to the lower-bound on $\\Delta_t$ given in Lemma \\[lem:lower-bound\\] (the lemma is proven in Section \\[sec:lower-boundproof\\] in the Supplementary material).\n\nThe entropy reduction $\\Delta_t$ of Equation \\[eqn:ent-decrease\\] can be lower-bounded as follows $$\\Delta_t \\geq\n\\frac{J(h)^2G_t}{8\\beta(1-\\beta)t\\ln k}$$ \\[lem:lower-bound\\]\n\nLemma \\[lem:lower-bound\\] implies that the larger the objective $J(h)$ is at time $t$, the larger the entropy reduction ends up being, which further reinforces intuitions to maximize $J$. In general, it might not be possible to find any hypothesis with a large enough objective $J(h)$ to guarantee sufficient progress at this point so we appeal to a *weak learning assumption*. This assumption can be used to further lower-bound $\\Delta_t$. The lower-bound can then be used (details are in Section \\[sec:maindetails\\] in the Supplementary material) to obtain the main theoretical statement of the paper captured in Theorem \\[thm:main\\].\n\nFrom the definition of $\\gamma$ it follows that $1 - \\gamma \\geq \\beta \\geq \\gamma$. Also note that the *weak hypothesis assumption* guarantees $J(h) \\geq 2\\gamma$, which applied to the lower-bound on $\\Delta_t$ captured in Lemma \\[lem:lower-bound\\] yields $$\\Delta_t \\geq \\frac{\\gamma^2G_t}{2(1 - \\gamma)^2t\\ln k}.\n\\vspace{-0.05in}$$ Let $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{(1 - \\gamma)^2\\ln k}}\\gamma$. Then $\\Delta_t > \\frac{\\eta^2G_t}{16t}$. Thus we obtain the recurrence inequality $$G_{t+1} \\leq G_t - \\Delta_t < G_t - \\frac{\\eta^2G_t}{16t} =\nG_t\\left[1 - \\frac{\\eta^2}{16t}\\right] \n\\vspace{-0.02in}$$ One can now compute the minimum number of splits required to reduce $G_t$ below $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$. Applying the proof technique from [@Kearns95] (the proof of Theorem 10) gives the final statement of Theorem \\[thm:main\\].\n\nProof of Lemma \\[lem:lower-bound\\] {#sec:lower-boundproof}\n==================================\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $P_1 \\leq P_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq P_k$. As mentioned before, the entropy reduction $\\Delta_t$ corresponds to a gap in the Jensen’s inequality applied to the concave function $\\tilde{G}(\\bm \\pi)$. Also recall that Shannon entropy is strongly concave with respect to $\\ell_1$-norm (see e.g., Example 2.5 in Shalev-Shwartz [@ShaiSS2012]). As a specific consequence (see e.g. Theorem 2.1.9 in Nesterov [@Nesterov2004]) we obtain $$\\Delta_t \\geq w\\beta(1-\\beta)\\|{\\bm \\pi}_0 - {\\bm \\pi}_1\\|_1^2 = \\frac{w}{\\beta(1-\\beta)}\\left(\\sum_{i\n  = 1}^k\\left|\\pi_i(P_i - \\beta)\\right|\\right)^2 =\n\\frac{wJ(h)^2}{4\\beta(1 - \\beta)},\n\\label{eq:subst}$$ where the last equality results from the definition of $J(h) = 2\\sum_{i =\n  1}^k\\pi_i|P_i - \\beta|$.\n\nNote that the following holds $w \\geq\n\\frac{G_t}{2t\\ln k}$, where recall that $w$ is the weight of the heaviest leaf in the tree, i.e. the leaf with the highest weight, at round $t$. This leaf is selected to the currently considered split [@Kearns95]. In particular, the lower-bound on $w$ is the consequence of the following $$G_t \\!=\\! \\sum_{l \\in \\mathcal{L}}\\!\\!w_l\\!\\sum_{i = 1}^k\\!\\! \\pi_{l,i}\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi_{l,i}} \\right)\n\\leq \\sum_{l \\in \\mathcal{L}}\\!\\!w_l\\ln k \\leq 2tw\\ln k,$$ where $w = \\max_{l \\in \\mathcal{L}}w_l$. Thus $w \\geq \\frac{G_t}{2t\\ln\n  k}$ which when substituted to Equation \\[eq:subst\\] gives the final statement of the lemma.\n\nProof of Lemma \\[lemma:sb\\]\n===========================\n\nWe bound the number of swaps that any node makes. Consider $R_S =\n4$ and let $j$ be the node that is about to split and $s$ be the orphan node that will be recycled (thus $C_r = C_s$). The condition in Equation \\[eq:swap\\_cond\\] implies that the swap is done if $C_j > 4(C_r + 1) = 4(C_s + 1)$. Algorithm \\[alg:OTT\\] makes $s$ a child of $j$ during the swap and sets its counter to $C_s^{new} =\n\\floor*{C_j/2} \\geq 2(C_r + 1) = 2(C_s + 1)$. Then $C_r$ gets updated. Since the value of $C_s^{new}$ at least doubles after a swap and all counters are bounded by the number of examples $n$, the node can be involved in at most $\\log_2 n$ swaps.\n\nEquivalent forms of the objective function {#sec:explanation}\n==========================================\n\nConsider the objective function as given in Equation \\[eqn:objective\\] $$J(h) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^k \\pi_i \\left| P(h(x) > 0) - P(h(x) > 0 | i)\n  \\right|.$$ Recall that $\\mathcal{X}$ denotes the set of all examples and let $\\mathcal{X}_i$ denote the set of examples in class $i$. Also let $|\\mathcal{X}|$ denote the cardinality of set $\\mathcal{X}$ and let $|\\mathcal{X}_i|$ denote the cardinality of set $\\mathcal{X}_i$. Then we can re-write the objective as $$\\begin{aligned}\nJ(h) &=& 2\\sum_{i=1}^k \\pi_i \\left| \\frac{\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}}\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0)}{|\\mathcal{X}|} - \\frac{\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}_i}\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0)}{|\\mathcal{X}_i|}\n  \\right| \\nonumber\\\\\n&=& 2\\sum_{i=1}^k \\pi_i \\left| \\mathbb{E}_x[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0|i)]\n  \\right| \\nonumber\\\\\n&=& 2\\mathbb{E}_i[\\left| \\mathbb{E}_x[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0)] - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\mathds{1}(h(x) > 0|i)]\n  \\right|]. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}$$\n\nToy example of the behavior of LOMtree algorithm {#sec:toy}\n================================================\n\nFigure \\[fig:root\\_example\\] shows the toy example of the behavior of LOMtree algorithm for the first few data points. Without loss of generality we consider the root node (exactly the same actions would be performed in any other tree node). Notice that the algorithm achieves simultaneously balanced and pure split of classes reaching the considered node.\n\n$e$ denotes the expectation $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)]$, and $e1,e2,e3,e4$ denote the expectations $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)|i = 1]$, $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)|i = 2]$, $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)|i = 3]$, and $\\mathbb{E}_x[h(x)|i = 4]$. For simplicity we assume score $h(x)$ can only be either $1$ (if the example is sent to the right) or $-1$ (if the example is sent to the left). The figure should be read as follows (we explain how to read first few illustrations):\n\n1.  Root is initialized. Expectation $e$ is initialized to $0$.\n\n2.  The first example $x1$ comes with label $1$ (we denote it as $(x1,1)$). $e1$ is initialized to $0$. The difference between $e$ and $e1$ is computed: $e - e1 = 0$. The difference is non-positive thus the example is sent to the right child of the root, which is now being created (the left child is created along with the right child as we always create both children of any node simultaneously).\n\n3.  Expectations $e$ and $e1$ get updated. It is shown that root and its right child saw an example of class $1$.\n\n4.  The second example $x2$ comes with label $2$ (we denote it as $(x2,2)$). $e2$ is initialized to $0$. The difference between $e$ and $e2$ is computed: $e - e2 = 1$. The difference is positive thus the example is sent to the left child of the root.\n\n5.  Expectations $e$ and $e2$ get updated. It is shown that root saw examples of class $1$ and $2$, whereas its resp. left and right child saw example of class resp. $2$ and $1$.\n\n6.  $\\dots$\n\na\\) b) c)\\\nd) e) f)\\\ng) h) i)\\\nj) k)\n\nExperiments - dataset details\n=============================\n\nBelow we provide the details of the datasets that we were using for the experiments in Section \\[sec:experiments\\]:\n\n-   *Isolet*: downloaded from <http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/datasets/ClassificationDatasets.html>\n\n-   *Sector* and *Aloi*: downloaded from <http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html>\n\n-   *ImageNet* [@Deng09imagenet:a]: features extracted according to <http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/cnn/>, dataset obtained from the authors.\n\n-   *ODP* [@conf/sigir/BennettN09]: obtained from Paul Bennett.

{"text": "Are You Leaving Room for Magic?\n\nAre you leaving room for magic in your life? Or are you trying to figure everything out? Are you letting things line up on their own or are you trying to control all the details?\n\nI’m getting ready to leave for a trip to Italy in a few days and I wanted to share with you how this trip, that has been on my desire list and many dream boards in the past several years, came into being.\n\nNine years ago when my youngest child was born, I was struggling. My husband and I were running our fledgling heating and cooling business and I had given birth to our fourth child. We had a 6-year-old, two 15 month-olds and a newborn. Let’s just say even getting to the grocery store and back home again was a challenge. I needed help and I dreamed of having a living helper who would go with us when I wanted her to and stay at home with the children when I needed her to. It seemed like a complete fantasy that could never happen.\n\nAt that time, I had heard of au pairs, live-in child-care providers from foreign countries, but had no idea how to get one and I didn’t believe we could afford one. But after dreaming about how wonderful it would be to have one, only two months later our first au pair arrived. Sycronicities, one after another, lined up as we met people who had au pairs and found it was easy and affordable for us to get one.\n\nOver the next few years, we had 4 wonderful au pairs and now have friends from Estonia, Brazil, Thailand and Poland. It was the incredible experience that I had dreamed it would be. Awesome childcare and expanding knowledge of other cultures. I have such fond memories of those years. Years that could have been crazy but instead were so much easier and more entertaining with an extra set of hands. It was so fun to have someone live with us and teach us about their culture as they became part of ours.\n\nIt renewed my desire to travel abroad. One of our au pairs went on to live in Italy for a year and sparked a desire in us to go. I wrote a blog post on my first blog, that probably doesn’t exist on the internet anymore, about how I knew that we would be able to stretch beyond the level we were at and be able to take this trip to Italy. At that time it was a huge financial leap for us, so I put it on the back burner. We tried to plan it a few times but it fell through each time. I didn’t worry about how or when it would happen but I had a picture of it unfolding perfectly.\n\nNow, my children are at an age that it’s much easier for us to travel and our home school group is hosting a trip to Italy this year. Still, even plane tickets for six people to go to Italy can be pricey. I didn’t even consider it until the last day to sign up. We suddenly had a large chunk of change come into our business and everything synchronized so that in 24 hour period the trip went from not being on my radar to being booked and paid for. I didn’t take care of the details or figure out how the trip would come about or be paid for, the universe did the heavy lifting for me.\n\nSo, if you have a big dream, take some time to feel how fun it would be to experience it and then leave it up to the universe to provide the magic. It might happen tomorrow, or next year, or like my Italy trip, it could take 8 years. Trust that it will come when it’s time and then, when you get inspired, take action. Now looking back to the times I wanted to take this trip before but it didn’t materialize, it was a good thing. Going to Italy with 3 and 4 years old or 6 and 7 year olds would likely have been much more challenging than going with 9 and 10 year olds. My children are 15, 10, 10 and 9 now. It seems like it’s all coming together at the perfect time for us to get maximum enjoyment from the trip.\n\nTake action when you are called to, but don’t beat yourself if you fail to take the leap. If I hadn’t booked the trip once I got the intuitive hit that now was the time, I wouldn’t be going to Italy next week. That doesn’t mean that the Universe couldn’t or wouldn’t line up more opportunities for me. The more we pay attention and act on the magic given us the more we will experience magic in our lives. I knew that we would go some day and I’m excited that the time is now, but I’m confident that if I had passed on this opportunity, the universe would line up another one.\n\nLet the universe bring you some magic, too. Dream big, feel what it feels like to experience your dreams and then step back and live in joyous anticipation of all the magic that is coming your way.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "My View: Funding for the future\n\nCreated on Friday, 16 January 2015 00:00 | Written by Joe Robertson |\n\nFor decades, medical research  and the cures and treatments it has discovered  have meant hope for millions of American living with disease and disability. But in recent years, those hopes have been clouded as Congress continues to significantly underfund the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe funding agreement for the 2015 fiscal year that Congress approved recently does little to improve the situation. The agreement appropriately includes a boost in funding for Ebola research, but it provides only a small increase in funding for the rest of the NIHs budget  which was cut by a disabling $1.7\n\nbillion two years ago and has been largely flat over the past 10 years. The small increase for 2015  about one-half of 1 percent  wont allow NIH funding to even keep pace with inflation.\n\nAll of us associated with Oregon Health & Science University  health care providers, scientists and patients  are relieved that Congress at least avoided a government shutdown in approving the agreement. But we are disappointed that the spending bill fails to adequately fund the lifesaving research the NIH supports. And we will continue to call on Congress to fund the NIH appropriately, and give U.S. medical researchers the support they need to lead the world.\n\nFor nearly 70 years, the nations research investment through the NIH has improved our understanding of the causes of disease, increased life expectancy, and enhanced the health and well-being of Americans everywhere. Every day, health care professionals and scientists throughout the nation, including at OHSU, see the hope that medical research brings.\n\nNIH-funded research has led to a decline of more than 60 percent in deaths from heart disease and stroke. NIH-supported advances also have led to a test to predict breast cancer recurrence, the discovery of genetic markers for complex illnesses, improved asthma treatments, and the near-elimination of HIV transmission between mother and child.\n\nAt OHSU, NIH funding has allowed us to make medical and scientific breakthroughs in cancer, stem cell research and infectious diseases, among many other areas. With funding from the NIH, Brian Druker, director of the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, helped develop Gleevec, a breakthrough drug for chronic myeloid leukemia that also served as proof that targeted cancer treatment could work.\n\nPatients who once were expected to live three to five years now have a normal life expectancy because of the drug.\n\nIn recent years, other OHSU scientists have used NIH funding to make significant advances in the quest to employ stem cells to cure disease, in uncovering the epigenetic basis for chronic diseases, and in developing a vaccine that may someday wipe out HIV infection from the body.\n\nRebuilding the NIH budget also would be good for our countrys fiscal health. The research funded by NIH that mostly occurs at our nations medical schools and teaching hospitals creates skilled jobs, new products, and improved technologies. In 2012, NIH-funded research supported more than 400,000 jobs across the country.\n\nLast year, the federal government provided OHSU scientists with $272 million in support for medical research, including $232 million from the NIH. That money not only helps our scientists continually make advances in treating and curing disease, it also provides a significant economic impact for the state of Oregon  an economic impact that was measured at more than $600 million for the 2009 fiscal year. The economic impact is undoubtedly larger today.\n\nBut this issue is about much more than economic impact, of course. This issue is about treating disease, curing disease  and providing hope.\n\nAmericans want cures, not cuts. OHSU and the nations medical schools and teaching hospitals urge Congress to restore the NIH budget and reaffirm medical research as a national priority.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Eye for an eye\n\n\"An eye for an eye\" () or the law of retaliation () is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation. The intent behind the principle was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss.\n\nDefinition and methods\nThe term lex talionis does not always and only refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see rather mirror punishment) but applies to the broader class of legal systems that specify formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party or the state.  The most common expression of lex talionis is \"an eye for an eye\", but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of lex talionis have one thing in common: prescribed 'fitting' counter punishment for a felony. In the famous legal code written by Hammurabi, the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.\n\nThe simplest example is the \"eye for an eye\" principle.  In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime. Conversely, the Twelve Tables of Rome merely prescribed particular penalties for particular crimes. The Anglo-Saxon legal code substituted payment of wergild for direct retribution: a particular person's life had a fixed value, derived from his social position; any homicide was compensated by paying the appropriate wergild, regardless of intent. Under the British Common Law, successful plaintiffs were entitled to repayment equal to their loss (in monetary terms). In the modern tort law system, this has been extended to translate non-economic losses into money as well.  The meaning of the principle Eye for an Eye is that a person who has been injured by another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation, or that an authority does so on behalf of the injured person. The exact Latin (lex talionis) to English translation of this phrase is \"The law of retaliation.\" The root principle of this law is to provide equitable retribution.\n\nAntecedents\nVarious ideas regarding the origins of lex talionis exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, feuds and vendettas, threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, lex talionis systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms.\n\nThe principle is found in Babylonian Law. If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take vengeful retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society.  As with blasphemy or lèse-majesté (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one's social betters were punished more severely.\n\nRoman law moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance.  In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although talio was still permitted if one person broke another's limb.\n\nIn religion\nThe earliest known use of the principle appears in the Code of Hammurabi, which predates the Hebrew bible.  In the Hebrew Law, the \"eye for eye\" was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss. Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'.  The idiomatic biblical phrase \"an eye for an eye\" in Exodus and Leviticus (, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally  \"eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth\") is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses. The passage in Leviticus states, \"And a man who injures his countrymanas he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him.\" (Lev. 24:19–21). For an example of  being used in its regular sense of under, see Lev. 22:27 \"A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day...\"\n\nThe Bible allows for kofer (a monetary payment) to take the place of a bodily punishment for any crime except murder. It is not specified whether the victim, accused, or judge had the authority to choose kofer in place of bodily punishment.\n\nJudaism\nIsaac Kalimi explains that the \"lex talionis was humanized by the Rabbis who interpreted \"an eye for an eye\" to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian 'lex talionis', ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the peshat (literal meaning) of the written Torah. Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to \"adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas.\"\n\nTalmud\nThe Talmud interprets the verses referring to \"an eye for an eye\" and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.\n\nHowever, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase ayin tachat ayin makes another appearance. Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to \"do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother\". Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.\n\nSince there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot.  There is one case where the Torah states \"…and you shall cut off her hand…\"  The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner.  This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury. Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.\n\n discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of \"redeemer of blood\". In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the \"redeemer of blood\" may not kill him.  If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the \"redeemer of blood\", as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party. Nevertheless, the provision of the \"redeemer of blood\" does not serve as true reciprocal justice, because the redeemer only acts to penalize a negligent killer who forgoes his exile. Furthermore, intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus cannot serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter, but as a penalty for escaping punishment.  According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud.  The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.\n\nObjective of reciprocal justice in Judaism\nThe Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (middah k'neged middah) in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society (\"…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst\") and to deter potential criminals from violating the law (\"And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst\"). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).\n\nThe ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether or not the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.\n\nSocial hierarchy and reciprocal justice\nIn Exodus 21, as in the Code of Hammurabi, the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe\" is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.\n\nHowever the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the \"eye for eye\" principle is directly followed by the proclamation \"You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen.\"  This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan, \"to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them.\"\n\nChristianity\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek:\n\nSome interpret this as an admonition not to seek legal steps for any compensation that corresponds in kind and degree to the injury. Others interpret it as Jesus simply teaching his followers not to take personal vengeance, rather than commenting on any specific legal practice.\n\nChristian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the Church father Augustine of Hippo. He already discussed in his Contra Faustum, Book XIX, the points of 'fulfilment or destruction' of the Jewish law. George Robinson characterizes the passage of Exodus (\"an eye for an eye\") as one of the \"most controversial in the Bible\". According to Robinson, some have pointed to this passage as evidence of the vengeful nature of justice in the Hebrew Bible. Similarly, Abraham Bloch speculates that the \"lex talionis has been singled out as a classical example of biblical harshness.\"  Harry S. Lewis points to Lamech, Gideon and Samson as Biblical heroes who were renowned for \"their prowess in executing blood revenge upon their public and private enemies.\" Lewis asserts that this \"right of 'wild' justice was gradually limited.\"  Stephen Wylen asserts that the lex talionis is \"proof of the unique value of each individual\" and that it teaches \"equality of all human beings for law.\"\n\nIslam\n\nThe Qur'an mentions the \"eye for an eye\" concept as being ordained for the Children of Israel. The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in : \"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (Qisas) for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.  But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.\" Muslim countries that use Islamic Sharia law, such as Iran or Saudi Arabia, apply the \"eye for an eye\" rule literally.\n\nApplications\nThe group Nakam sought to kill six  million Germans as  revenge for the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust.\n In 2017, an Iranian woman wounded in an acid attack was given the opportunity to have her attacker blinded with acid per sharia law.\n\nNotable criticism\n Mahatma Gandhi allegedly used this phrase in the context of universal harmony: \"An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.\"\n Coretta Scott King later used this phrase in the context of racial violence: \"The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.\"\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n .\n .\n\nExternal links\n .\n .\n \n : the author of \"Eye for an Eye\", about the Lex talionis.\n .\n  & Part 2\n .\n\nCategory:Criminal law\nCategory:English-language idioms\nCategory:Codes of conduct\nCategory:Legal history\nCategory:Law and morality\nCategory:Biblical phrases\nCategory:Islamic terminology\nCategory:Christian terminology\nCategory:Revenge\nCategory:Human eyes in culture", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nReveal.js presentation full screen from JHipster\n\nI am trying to show a reveal.js presentation full screen from a JHipster single page app. The reveal.js example below works fine inside JHipster, it's just not full screen.  It can be made full screen by creating a second page, but given JHipster's design as a single page app things get messy with grunt and the production profile. I've also tried hiding the app menu bar and footer div elements but the reveal presentation still has padding around it. Ideally a full-screen view can configured.\nSimple Reveal slide\n<div ng-cloak>\n  <div class=\"reveal\">\n    <div class=\"slides\">\n      <section data-background=\"#faebd7\">\n        <h1>FULL SCREEN SLIDE</h1>\n       </section>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nA:\n\nI solved the problem while keeping it a single page app. Previously I tried hiding elements of the page that prevented full-screen, but padding on the main div container was preventing full screen. The solution was to create a second ui-view div designed for full screen and hide all other div elements.\nSolution:\n1. Add \"hidewhenfullscreen\" class to the elements to hide.\n2. Use javascript to show/hide elements\n3. Add a second fullpage ui-view designed for full screen\n4. Reference the fullpage ui-view from the controller\nindex.html\n<div ng-show=\"{{ENV === 'dev'}}\" class=\"development hidewhenfullscreen\" ng-cloak=\"\"></div>\n<div ui-view=\"navbar\" ng-cloak=\"\" class=\"hidewhenfullscreen\"></div>\n<div class=\"container hidewhenfullscreen\">\n    <div class=\"well\" ui-view=\"content\"></div>\n\n    <div class=\"footer\">\n        <p translate=\"footer\">This is your footer</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nJavaScript to show/hide elements\n<script>\n    hide(document.querySelectorAll('.hidewhenfullscreen'));\n\n    function hide (elements) {\n        elements = elements.length ? elements : [elements];\n        for (var index = 0; index < elements.length; index++) {\n            elements[index].style.display = 'none';\n        }\n    }\n    function show (elements) {\n        elements = elements.length ? elements : [elements];\n        for (var index = 0; index < elements.length; index++) {\n            elements[index].style.display = 'block';\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\nJavaScript controller\n    .state('show', {\n        parent: '',\n        url: '/show/{presentationName}',\n        data: {\n            authorities: [],  // none, wide open\n            pageTitle: 'page title'\n        },\n        views: {\n            'fullpage@': {\n                templateUrl: 'scripts/show/show.html',\n                controller: 'ShowController'\n            }\n        }\n    })\n\nThe page has a single small \"Home\" href that calls the show function. This way the user can go back and forth between the full-screen Reveal presentation and the standard jHipster view.\nshow.html\n<div ng-show=\"{{ENV === 'dev'}}\" class=\"development\"></div>\n<div class=\"miniMenu\" id=\"miniMenu\" ng-cloak=\"\">\n    <a href=\"/\" onClick=\"show(document.querySelectorAll('.hidewhenfullscreen')); \">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reveal\">\n    <div class=\"slides\">\n        <section data-background={{getBackgroundURI($index)}} ng-repeat=\"slide in slides track by $index\">\n            <div ng-bind-html=\"getContent($index)\"></div>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nFor completeness, creating a second page can work but I don't think it is worth the added complexity. A two-page solution worked fine in the development profile, but the production profile had issues with caching shared css files, js files and fonts. With time and energy, I am sure the proper grunt configuration can be made to work, although the idea seems to counter the single page design concept. While in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Contender (dinghy)\n\nThe International Contender is a single-handed high performance sailing dinghy, designed by Bob Miller, latterly known as Ben Lexcen, (Australia) in 1967 as a possible successor to the Finn dinghy for Olympic competition.\n\nThe Contender is recognised as an International Class by World Sailing, the governing body of sail boat racing, which administers the class rules.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Single-handed\" means sailed by only one person. The boat has a trapeze which allows the sailor to use their weight more effectively. The design of the boat does not favour sailors within a narrow or extreme size or weight range, past champions have ranged from 60 kg to more than 90 kg. While physical fitness, agility and strength are advantageous, good technical sailing skills and experience can count for more.\n\nSailors wishing to master the Contender must learn how to trapeze and steer the boat at the same time, and how to move about the boat while keeping it level. As part of race tuning, the Contender mast is commonly raked well aft, which results in restricted space between the boom and deck. Tacking consequently requires technique and practice to avoid getting stuck under the boom. Sailing the boat level at all times (except in very light winds) is fastest and reduces capsizes, which can happen fast if the boom dips into the water. There is a trade-off between raking the mast far aft and keeping the kicker (boom vang) tight at all times (which is faster) and the higher probability of capsizing due to this less forgiving set up. Unlike older and heavier dinghy designs, the Contender requires the centerboard to be lowered at least somewhat to avoid quick capsizes when reaching and running in a breeze.\n\nClass rule changes\nThe class rules are overseen by the International Contender Association. Proposals for changes to the rules are written down and presented to the class members during the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Before a rule change is taken into effect, the proposal needs to be approved by 2/3 of the member attending the AGM. If the proposal is approved, a next voting round will be done using a postal ballot. If a majority approves, the proposal will go to World Sailing for their approval. If this passes, the rules are updated and effected.\nNotable changes to the class rules are for instance:\n allow other materials than aluminium for masts; proposal in 2000  and a rule change in 2002\n allow loose footed sail; proposal in 2000  and a rule change in 2002\n allow other material than aluminium for the boom; proposal in 2002  and a rule change in 2003 \nThe Contender Microsite on World Sailing has a section with the latest class rules.\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Championships\n\nEuropean Championships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nClass associations\n International Contender Association\n British Contender Association\n Danish Contender Association\n Dutch Contender Association\nGerman Contender Association\n Italian Contender Association\nFrench Contender Association (In French)\n\nOthers\n International Contender Class Rules 2015\n World Sailing Contender Microsite\n World Sailing\n\nCategory:Dinghies\nCategory:Classes of World Sailing\nCategory:1960s sailboat type designs\nCategory:Sailboat type designs by Australian designers", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Will the recent rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, be a tipping point in the struggle against racial injustice, or will it be a minor footnote in some future grad student’s thesis on Civil Unrest in the Early Twenty-First Century?\n\nThe answer can be found in May of 1970.\n\nYou probably have heard of the Kent State shootings: on May 4, 1970, the Ohio National Guard opened fire on student protesters at Kent State University. During those 13 seconds of gunfire, four students were killed and nine were wounded, one of whom was permanently paralyzed. The shock and outcry resulted in a nationwide strike of 4 million students that closed more than 450 campuses. Five days after the shooting, 100,000 protestors gathered in Washington, D.C. And the nation’s youth was energetically mobilized to end the Vietnam War, racism, sexism, and mindless faith in the political establishment.\n\nYou probably haven’t heard of the Jackson State shootings.\n\nOn May 14th, 10 days after Kent State ignited the nation, at the predominantly black Jackson State University in Mississippi, police killed two black students (one a high school senior, the other the father of an 18-month-old baby) with shotguns and wounded twelve others.\n\nThere was no national outcry. The nation was not mobilized to do anything. That heartless leviathan we call History swallowed that event whole, erasing it from the national memory.\n\nAnd, unless we want the Ferguson atrocity to also be swallowed and become nothing more than an intestinal irritant to history, we have to address the situation not just as another act of systemic racism, but as what else it is: class warfare.\n\nVOTE: Should the Ferguson Protestors Be TIME’s Person of the Year?\n\nBy focusing on just the racial aspect, the discussion becomes about whether Michael Brown’s death—or that of the other three unarmed black men who were killed by police in the U.S. within that month—is about discrimination or about police justification. Then we’ll argue about whether there isn’t just as much black-against-white racism in the U.S. as there is white-against-black. (Yes, there is. But, in general, white-against-black economically impacts the future of the black community. Black-against-white has almost no measurable social impact.)\n\nThen we’ll start debating whether or not the police in America are themselves an endangered minority who are also discriminated against based on their color—blue. (Yes, they are. There are many factors to consider before condemning police, including political pressures, inadequate training, and arcane policies.) Then we’ll question whether blacks are more often shot because they more often commit crimes. (In fact, studies show that blacks are targeted more often in some cities, like New York City. It’s difficult to get a bigger national picture because studies are woefully inadequate. The Department of Justice study shows that in the U.S. between 2003 and 2009, among arrest-related deaths there’s very little difference among blacks, whites, or Latinos. However, the study doesn’t tell us how many were unarmed.)\n\nThis fist-shaking of everyone’s racial agenda distracts America from the larger issue that the targets of police overreaction are based less on skin color and more on an even worse Ebola-level affliction: being poor. Of course, to many in America, being a person of color is synonymous with being poor, and being poor is synonymous with being a criminal. Ironically, this misperception is true even among the poor.\n\nAnd that’s how the status quo wants it.\n\nThe U.S. Census Report finds that 50 million Americans are poor. Fifty million voters is a powerful block if they ever organized in an effort to pursue their common economic goals. So, it’s crucial that those in the wealthiest One Percent keep the poor fractured by distracting them with emotional issues like immigration, abortion and gun control so they never stop to wonder how they got so screwed over for so long.\n\nOne way to keep these 50 million fractured is through disinformation. PunditFact’s recent scorecard on network news concluded that at Fox and Fox News Channel, 60 percent of claims are false. At NBC and MSNBC, 46 percent of claims were deemed false. That’s the “news,” folks! During the Ferguson riots, Fox News ran a black and white photo of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., with the bold caption: “Forgetting MLK’s Message/Protestors in Missouri Turn to Violence.” Did they run such a caption when either Presidents Bush invaded Iraq: “Forgetting Jesus Christ’s Message/U.S. Forgets to Turn Cheek and Kills Thousands”?\n\nVOTE: Should the Ferguson protestors be TIME’s Person of the Year?\n\nHow can viewers make reasonable choices in a democracy if their sources of information are corrupted? They can’t, which is exactly how the One Percent controls the fate of the Ninety-Nine Percent.\n\nWorse, certain politicians and entrepreneurs conspire to keep the poor just as they are. On his HBO comedic news show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver ran an expose of the payday loan business and those who so callously exploit the desperation of the poor. How does an industry that extorts up to 1,900 percent interest on loans get away with it? In Texas, State Rep. Gary Elkins blocked a regulatory bill, despite the fact that he owns a chain of payday loan stores. And the politician who kept badgering Elkins about his conflict of interest, Rep. Vicki Truitt, became a lobbyist for ACE Cash Express just 17 days after leaving office. In essence, Oliver showed how the poor are lured into such a loan, only to be unable to pay it back and having to secure yet another loan. The cycle shall be unbroken.\n\nDystopian books and movies like Snowpiercer, The Giver, Divergent, Hunger Games, and Elysium have been the rage for the past few years. Not just because they express teen frustration at authority figures. That would explain some of the popularity among younger audiences, but not among twentysomethings and even older adults. The real reason we flock to see Donald Sutherland’s porcelain portrayal in Hunger Games of a cold, ruthless president of the U.S. dedicated to preserving the rich while grinding his heel into the necks of the poor is that it rings true in a society in which the One Percent gets richer while our middle class is collapsing.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole; statistics prove this to be true. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center report, just half of U.S. households are middle-income, a drop of 11 percent since the 1970s; median middle-class income has dropped by 5 percent in the last ten years, total wealth is down 28 percent. Fewer people (just 23 percent) think they will have enough money to retire. Most damning of all: fewer Americans than ever believe in the American Dream mantra that hard work will get them ahead.\n\nRather than uniting to face the real foe—do-nothing politicians, legislators, and others in power—we fall into the trap of turning against each other, expending our energy battling our allies instead of our enemies. This isn’t just inclusive of race and political parties, it’s also about gender. In her book Unspeakable Things: Sex, Lies and Revolution, Laurie Penny suggests that the decreased career opportunities for young men in society makes them feel less valuable to females; as a result they deflect their rage from those who caused the problem to those who also suffer the consequences: females.\n\nYes, I’m aware that it is unfair to paint the wealthiest with such broad strokes. There are a number of super-rich people who are also super-supportive of their community. Humbled by their own success, they reach out to help others. But that’s not the case with the multitude of millionaires and billionaires who lobby to reduce Food Stamps, give no relief to the burden of student debt on our young, and kill extensions of unemployment benefits.\n\nWith each of these shootings/chokehold deaths/stand-your-ground atrocities, police and the judicial system are seen as enforcers of an unjust status quo. Our anger rises, and riots demanding justice ensue. The news channels interview everyone and pundits assign blame.\n\nThen what?\n\nI’m not saying the protests in Ferguson aren’t justified—they are. In fact, we need more protests across the country. Where’s our Kent State? What will it take to mobilize 4 million students in peaceful protest? Because that’s what it will take to evoke actual change. The middle class has to join the poor and whites have to join African-Americans in mass demonstrations, in ousting corrupt politicians, in boycotting exploitative businesses, in passing legislation that promotes economic equality and opportunity, and in punishing those who gamble with our financial future.\n\nOtherwise, all we’re going to get is what we got out of Ferguson: a bunch of politicians and celebrities expressing sympathy and outrage. If we don’t have a specific agenda—a list of exactly what we want to change and how—we will be gathering over and over again beside the dead bodies of our murdered children, parents, and neighbors.\n\nI hope John Steinbeck is proven right when he wrote in Grapes of Wrath, “Repression works only to strengthen and knit the oppressed.” But I’m more inclined to echo Marvin Gaye’s “Inner City Blues,” written the year after the Kent State/Jackson State shootings:\n\nInflation no chance\n\nTo increase finance\n\nBills pile up sky high\n\nSend that boy off to die\n\nMake me wanna holler\n\nThe way they do my life\n\nMake me wanna holler\n\nThe way they do my life\n\nRead next: Ferguson: In Defense of Rioting\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

This is equivalent to the fact that $|Z|$ is in the maximal domain of attraction of the Fréchet distribution $\\Phi_{\\alpha}(x)=\\exp(-x^{-\\alpha})$, and if $\\alpha<2$, to the fact that $Z$ is in the domain of attraction of a stable distribution with index $\\alpha$. Another useful characterization states that $Z$ is regularly varying if and only if there exists a sequence $(a_n)_n \\uparrow \\infty$ such that $nP(|Z|>a_n x) \\to x^{-\\alpha}$ for any $x>0$. By considering the state space $\\barR_0=[-\\infty,\\infty] \\verb2\\2 \\{0\\}$ instead of $\\bR$ (such that sets of the from $[-\\infty,-x) \\cup (x,\\infty],x>0$ become relatively compact), the previous convergence can be expressed as the vague convergence of Radon measures: $$nP(a_n^{-1}Z \\in \\cdot) \\stackrel{v}{\\to}\\nu(\\cdot) \\quad \\mbox{in} \\ \\barR_0,$$ where $\\nu(dx)=[p\\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}1_{(0,\\infty)}(x)+(1-p)\\alpha (-x)^{-\\alpha-1}1_{(-\\infty,0)}(x)]dx$ is a measure on $\\barR_0$ with $\\nu(\\barR_0 \\verb2\\2 \\bR)=0$ (see e.g. Section 3.6 of [@resnick07]).\n\nRecall that a measure $\\mu$ on a locally compact space with a countable basis (LCCB) is [*Radon*]{} if $\\mu(B)<\\infty$ for any relatively compact Borel set $B$. A sequence $(\\mu_n)_n$ of Radon measures [*converges vaguely*]{} to a Radon measure $\\mu$ (written as $\\mu_n \\stackrel{v}{\\to} \\mu$) if $\\mu_n(B) \\to \\mu(B)$ for any relatively compact Borel set $B$ with $\\mu(\\partial B)=0$ (see Appendix 15.7 of [@kallenberg83]).\n\nIn higher dimensions, a random vector ${\\bf Z}$ with values in $\\bR^d$ is called [*regularly varying*]{} if there exist a sequence $(a_n)_n \\uparrow \\infty$ and a non-null Radon measure $\\nu$ on $\\barR_0^d=[-\\infty,\\infty]^d \\verb2\\2 \\{{\\bf 0}\\}$ such that $\\nu(\\barR_0^d \\verb2\\2 \\bR^d)=0$ and $$\\label{RV}\nnP(a_n^{-1}{\\bf Z} \\in \\cdot) \\stackrel{v}{\\to} \\nu(\\cdot) \\quad \\mbox{in} \\quad \\barR_0^d.$$ In this case, we write $Z \\in {\\rm RV}(\\{a_n\\},\\nu, \\barR_0^d)$. It can be proved that the measure $\\nu$ satisfies the following [*scaling property*]{}: there exists $\\alpha>0$ (called the index of ${\\bf Z}$) such that $\\nu(sB)=s^{-\\alpha} \\nu(B)$ for any $s>0$ and for any Borel set $B \\subset \\barR_0^d$. In particular, for any norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$ on $\\bR^d$ and for any $r>0$, $$n P(\\|{\\bf Z}\\|>a_n r) \\to cr^{-\\alpha},$$ where $c=\\nu(\\{{\\bf x} \\in \\barR_0^d;\\|{\\bf x}\\| >1\\})$. Let $\\bR_0^d=\\bR^d \\verb2\\2\\{{\\bf 0}\\}$, $\\bS=\\{{\\bf x} \\in \\bR^d; \\|{\\bf x}\\|=1\\}$ be the unit sphere in $\\bR^d$ and $T:\\bR_0^d  \\to (0,\\infty) \\times \\bS$ be the polar coordinate transformation: $T({\\bf x})=(\\|{\\bf x}\\|,{\\bf x}/\\|{\\bf x}\\|)$. The fact that ${\\bf Z} \\in {\\rm RV}(\\{a_n\\},\\nu,\\barR_0^d)$ can also be expressed as: (see e.g. Section 6.1 of [@resnick07]) $$\\label{RVpolar}\nnP(T(a_n^{-1}{\\bf Z}) \\in \\cdot) \\stackrel{v}{\\to} c\\nu_{\\alpha} \\times \\sigma \\quad \\mbox{in} \\quad (0,\\infty] \\times \\bS$$ where $\\nu_{\\alpha}(r,\\infty)=r^{-\\alpha}$ and $\\sigma$ is a probability measure on $\\bS$ given by $\\sigma(S)=c^{-1}\\nu(\\{{\\bf x} \\in \\barR_0^d; \\|{\\bf x}\\|>1,{\\bf x}/\\|{\\bf x}\\| \\in S\\})$. Hence, $\\nu \\circ T^{-1}=c\\nu_{\\alpha} \\times \\sigma$ on $(0,\\infty) \\times \\bS$.\n\nIn the one dimensional case, many time series models can be expressed as linear processes of the form: $$\\label{series}\nX_i=\\sum_{j \\geq 0}c_j Z_{i-j}, \\quad i \\in \\bZ$$ where $(c_j)_{j \\geq 1}$ are real numbers and $(Z_{j})_{j \\in \\bZ}$ are i.i.d. random variables. One simple example is the auto-regressive model of order 1, $X_i=a X_{i-1}+Z_i$ with $|a|<1$, leading to $X_i=\\sum_{j \\geq 0}a^{j}Z_{i-j}$. Assume that $Z_0$ is regularly varying with index $\\alpha$ and slowly varying function $L$ as above. A basic question is: under what conditions the series converges and if so, is $X_0$ still regularly varying? If $\\alpha<2$, an argument which can be traced back to [@astrauskas83] (see also Proposition 2.1 of [@BJL]) shows that the series converges a.s. if and only if $$\\sum_{j \\geq 0}|c_j|^{\\alpha}L(1/|c_j|)<\\infty.$$ In [@mikosch-samorod00], it was shown that sufficient conditions for the converges of the series are: $\\sum_{j \\geq 1}|c_j|^{\\alpha-\\gamma}<\\infty$ for some $\\gamma \\in (0,\\alpha)$, if $\\alpha \\leq 2$, and $\\sum_{j \\geq 0}|c_j|^2<\\infty$ if $\\alpha>2$, and under these conditions, $X_0$ is regularly varying. This result continues to hold for $d$-dimensional vectors $(Z_j)_j$, and deterministic $p \\times d$ matrices $(A_j)_j$ replacing the coefficients $(c_j)_j$ (see Corollary 3.1 of [@hult-samorod08]).\n\nMore interesting models lead to series of the form: $$\\label{series2}\nX_{i}=\\sum_{j \\geq 0}C_{i,j}Z_{i-j}, \\quad i \\in \\bZ$$ with random coefficients $C_{i,j}$. One such example is the stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X_i=Y_i X_{i-1} +Z_{i}$, where $\\{(Y_i,Z_i)\\}_{i \\in \\bZ}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random vectors in $\\bR^2$. Under certain conditions, it can be shown that (SRE) has a unique stationary solution which can be represented as a series of the form with $C_{i,0}=1$ and $C_{i,j}=\\prod_{k=1}^{j}Y_{i-k+1}$ for $j \\geq 1$. Another example is the bilinear model $X_i=cX_{i-1}Z_{i-1}+Z_i$, which admits a stationary solution of the form $X_i=Z_i+\\sum_{j \\geq 1}C_{i,j}Z_{i-j}^2$ with $C_{i,j}=\\prod_{k=1}^{j-1}Z_{i-k}$. Assume that $Z_0$ is regularly varying. The first result addressing the question mentioned above is due to [@resnick-willekens91], where it was shown that a series $X_0$ given by is regularly varying, if $(C_{0,j})_{j \\geq 0}$ and $(Z_{-j})_{j \\geq 0}$ are independent and $(C_{0,j})_{j \\geq 0}$ satisfy some moment conditions. This result was extended to (SRE) and the bilinear model in [@grey94], respectively [@davis-resnick96]. This was improved in [@hult-samorod08], under weaker moment conditions on $(C_{0,j})_{j \\geq 0}$ and a certain “predictability assumption” imposed on the sequence $\\{(C_{0,j},Z_{-j})_{j \\geq 0}$. The result of [@hult-samorod08] is in fact valid for random vectors, one of the major applications of (SRE) in higher dimensions being the GARCH model (see [@basrak-et-al02]).\n\nA breakthrough idea, which gave a new perspective to the concept of regular variation and lead to a different line of investigations, was introduced in [@dehaan-lin01]. Motivated by extreme value theory, this idea was to examine the [*global*]{} asymptotic behavior (as $t$ runs in a fixed interval $[0,1]$) of the normalized maximum process $\\{a_n^{-1}\\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq n}Z_i(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ associated with $n$ i.i.d. processes $Z_1, \\ldots,Z_n$ whose sample paths are càdlàg functions (i.e. continuous functions with left limits) on $[0,1]$. Each process $Z_i$ is interpreted as a collection of measurements observed continuously over a fixed linear spatial region, $Z_i(t)$ being the observation at location $t$ and time $i$. In the example of [@dehaan-lin01], $Z_i(t)$ is the high tide water level at location $t$ and time $i$, along the northern coast of the Netherlands. It turns out that if $Z_0$ is regularly varying (in a sense which is made precise in Section \\[regvarD-section\\] below), then the finite-dimensional distributions of the normalized maximum process converge to those of a càdlàg process $Y=\\{Y(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$, and if $Y$ has continuous sample paths, then the convergence is in distribution in the space $\\bD=\\bD[0,1]$ of càdlàg functions on $[0,1]$, endowed with the Skorohod $J_1$-topology (see Theorem 2.4 of [@dehaan-lin01]).\n\nThe notion of regular variation for càdlàg processes was thoroughly studied in [@hult-lindskog05] where it was proved that it is equivalent to the regular variation of the finite-dimensional distributions of the process, combined with some relative compactness conditions (see Theorem 10 of [@hult-lindskog05]). In particular, a Lévy process $\\{Z(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ is regularly varying if and only if $Z(1)$ is regularly varying (see Lemma 2.1 of [@hult-lindskog07]). One example is the $\\alpha$-stable Lévy process.\n\nIn this context, it becomes interesting to examine the regular variation of $\\bD$-valued time series of the form: $$\\label{series3}\nX_i(t)=\\sum_{j \\geq 0}\\psi_j(t)Z_{i-j}(t), \\quad t \\in [0,1],i \\in \\bZ$$ where $Z_i=\\{Z_i(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}, i \\in \\bZ$ are i.i.d. regularly varying processes and $\\psi_j=\\{\\psi_j(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]},j \\geq 0$ are deterministic functions in $\\bD$. This analysis was carried out in [@davis-mikosch08], where it was proved that, under some conditions on the coefficients $(\\psi_j)_{j \\geq 0}$, the series $X_0$ given by converges a.s. and is regularly varying in $\\bD$. Moreover, the authors of [@davis-mikosch08] derived the limit distribution of the normalized space-time maximum $a_n^{-1}\\max_{i \\leq n}\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]}|X_i(t)|$, using non-trivial point process techniques. We should note that the results of [@davis-mikosch08] are in fact valid for càdlàg processes indexed by $[0,1]^d$ with $d \\geq 1$, being motivated by applications to spatial processes.\n\nIn the present article, we consider the next natural step in this line of investigations which consists in examining series of the form: $$\\label{series4}\nX_{i}(t)=\\sum_{j \\geq 0}\\Psi_{i,j}(t)Z_{i-j}(t), \\quad t \\in [0,1],i \\in \\bZ$$ where $Z_i=\\{Z_i(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}, i \\in \\bZ$ are i.i.d. regularly varying processes and $\\Psi_{i,j}=\\{\\Psi_{i,j}(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ are random processes. For example, one can consider that at each spatial location $t$, the temporal dependence between the observations is described by an (SRE) model $X_i(t)=Y_i(t)X_{i-1}(t)+Z_i(t)$, leading to model with $\\Psi_{i,0}(t)=1$ and $\\Psi_{i,j}(t)=\\prod_{k=1}^{j}Y_{i-k+1}(t)$ for $j \\geq 1$. Our main result shows that, if $(\\Psi_{0,j})_{j \\geq 0}$ satisfy some moment conditions, and the same “predictability assumption” as in [@hult-samorod08] holds for the sequence $\\{(\\Psi_{0,j},Z_{-j})\\}_{j \\geq 0}$, then the series $X_0$ given by converges a.s. and is regularly varying in $\\bD$. We postpone the asymptotic analysis of the normalized maximum of $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ for a future study.\n\nThe article is organized as follows. In Section \\[regvarD-section\\], we introduce the concept of regular variation on $\\bD$ and discuss some of its properties. In Section \\[main-section\\], we state and prove our result about the regular variation in $\\bD$ of a series of the form . For this, we use two preliminary results, one of them being a version of Breiman’s lemma for $\\bD$-valued random elements. The appendix contains a variant of Pratt’s lemma (regarding the interchanging of $\\limsup$ with an integral), which is needed for checking the relative compactness conditions mentioned above.\n\nRegular variation on $\\bD$ {#regvarD-section}\n==========================\n\nIn this section, we recall the definition and main properties of the regular variation for random processes with sample paths in $\\bD$. We follow references [@lindskog04; @hult-lindskog05; @davis-mikosch08].\n\nWe let $\\bD=\\bD[0,1]$ be the space of right continuous functions $x:[0,1] \\to \\bR$ with left limits. Recall that $\\bD$ is a complete separable metric space (CSMS), equipped with a distance called $d_0$, which is equivalent to Skorohod $J_1$-metric (see pages 109-115 of [@billingsley68]). We denote by $\\cB(\\bD)$ the class of Borel sets in $\\bD$, equipped with the $J_1$-topology. Note that $\\|x\\|_{\\infty}=\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]}|x(t)|<\\infty$ for any $x \\in \\bD$, and the topology of uniform convergence on $\\bD$ is stronger than the $J_1$-topology.\n\nWe let $\\bS_{\\bD}=\\{x \\in \\bD; \\|x\\|_{\\infty}=1\\}$ be the “unit sphere” in $\\bD$, endowed with metric $d_0$, and $\\cB(\\bS_{\\bD})$ be the class of Borel sets in $\\bS_{\\bD}$. We denote $\\bD_0=\\bD \\verb2\\2 \\{0\\}$, where $0$ is the null function in $\\bD$, and let $\\cB(\\bD_0)$ be the class of Borel sets in $\\bD_0$. Similarly to the polar coordinate transformation in $\\bR^d$, we consider the homeomorphism $T: \\bD_0 \\to (0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$ given by $T(x)=(\\|x\\|_{\\infty},x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty})$. We define the space $$\\barD_0:=(0,\\infty] \\times \\bS_{\\bD}.$$ This space is endowed with the product metric, where $(0,\\infty]$ has the metric $\\rho(x,y)=(1/x)-(1/y)$, with the convention $1/\\infty=0$. We let $\\cB(\\barD_0)$ be the class of all Borel sets in $\\barD_0$. Note that $\\barD_0 \\verb2\\2 T(\\bD_0)=\\{\\infty\\} \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$.\n\n[The authors of [@lindskog04; @hult-lindskog05; @davis-mikosch08] identify the space $\\bD$ with $[0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$ and write $\\barD_0 \\verb2\\2 \\bD=\\{\\infty\\} \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$. For the sake of the analogy with $\\bR^d$, we prefer to distinguish between $\\bD_0$ and $(0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$.]{}\n\nSimilarly to $\\bR^d$, the concept of regular variation on $\\bD$ can be defined using convergence of measures. A small technical issue is the fact that $\\barD_0$ is not a LCCB space, and hence the notion of vague convergence is not appropriate on this space. Fortunately, $\\barD_0$ is a CSMS and vague convergence can be replaced by the $\\hat{w}$-convergence. Recall that a measure $\\mu$ on a CSMS $E$ (with metric $d$) is [*boundedly finite*]{} if $\\mu(B)<\\infty$ for any bounded Borel set $B$ in $E$. (A set $B$ is bounded if it is contained in an open sphere $S_{r}(x)=\\{y \\in E; d(x,y)<r\\}$.) A sequence $(\\mu_n)_n$ of boundedly finite measures converges to a boundedly finite measure $\\mu$ in the $\\hat{w}$-topology (written as $\\mu_n \\stackrel{\\hat{w}}{\\to} \\mu$) if $\\mu_n(B) \\to \\mu(B)$ for any bounded Borel set $B$ with $\\mu(\\partial B)=0$ (see Appendix A2.6 of [@D-VJ]).\n\nThe following definition introduces the analogue of for $\\bD$. Let $\\nu_{\\alpha}$ be the measure on $(0,\\infty]$ given by $\\nu_{\\alpha}(dx)=\\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}1_{(0,\\infty)}(x)dx$, $\\nu_{\\alpha}(\\{\\infty\\})=0$.\n\n\\[def-RV-D\\] [A process $Z=\\{Z(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ with sample paths in $\\bD$ is called [*regularly varying*]{} if there exist $\\alpha>0,c>0$, a sequence $(a_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ with $a_n>0,a_n \\uparrow \\infty$, and a probability measure $\\sigma$ on $\\bS_{\\bD}$ such that $$nP(T(a_n^{-1} Z) \\in \\cdot) \\stackrel{\\hat{w}}{\\to} c\\nu_{\\alpha} \\times \\sigma \\quad \\mbox{in} \\quad \\barD_0.$$ $\\alpha$ is called the [*index*]{} of $Z$. ]{}\n\n[The previous definition coincides with Definition 2 of [@hult-lindskog05], if we identify $T(x)$ with $x$, for any $x \\in \\bD_0$. Note that $\\mu=c\\nu_{\\alpha} \\times \\sigma$ is a non-null boundedly finite measure on $\\barD_0$ which satisfies $\\mu(\\{\\infty\\} \\times \\bS_{\\bD})=0$. ]{}\n\n[We now examine the analogue of for $\\bD$. Suppose that $Z$ is regularly varying as in Definition \\[def-RV-D\\]. Let $\\cP$ be the class of sets of the form $$V_{a,b;S}=\\{x \\in \\bD_0;a<\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq b, x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\in S \\}=T^{-1}((a,b] \\times S),$$ for some $0<a<b<\\infty$ and $S \\in \\cB(\\bS_{\\bD})$. Define $\\nu(V_{a,b;S})=c\\nu_{\\alpha}((a,b])\\sigma(S)$. Since $\\cP$ is a semiring which generates $\\cB(\\bD_0)$, by Theorem 11.3 of [@billingsley95], $\\nu$ can be extended to a measure on $\\bD_0$. Let $V_{r;S}=\\{x \\in \\bD;\\|x\\|_{\\infty}>r, x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\in S\\}$ be the $\\bD$-analogue of a “pizza-slice” set from $\\bR^d$, with $0<r<\\infty$. Then $$\\label{nu-of-V}\n\\nu(V_{r;S})=cr^{-\\alpha}\\sigma(S),$$ and hence $c=\\nu(V_{1; \\bS_{\\bD}})$. It can be shown that $\\nu$ satisfies the scaling property $\\nu(sB)=s^{-\\alpha} \\nu(B)$ for any $s>0$ and $B \\in \\cB(\\bD_0)$, $\\nu(\\partial V_{r;S})=cr^{-\\alpha}\\sigma(\\partial S)$ and $$\\label{conv}\nnP(a_n^{-1}Z \\in V_{r;S}) \\to \\nu(V_{r;S})$$ for any $r>0$ and $S \\in \\cB(\\bS_{\\bD})$ with $\\sigma(\\partial S)=0$ (see the proofs of Theorems 1.14 and 1.15 of [@lindskog04] for $\\bR^d$; the same arguments work for $\\bD$). But cannot be expressed as a statement of $\\hat{w}$-convergence, because there is no natural “infinity” that can be added to $\\bD_0$. Taking $S=\\bS_{\\bD}$ in , we obtain that for any $r>0$, $$\\label{tail-conv}\nnP(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty}>a_n r) \\to c r^{-\\alpha}.$$ By abuse of notation, we write $Z \\in {\\rm RV}(\\{a_n\\},\\nu, \\barD_0)$, although $\\nu$ is a measure on $\\bD_0$, not on $\\barD_0$. Note that $$\\nu \\circ T^{-1}=c\\nu_{\\alpha} \\times \\sigma \\quad \\mbox{on} \\quad (0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}.$$ ]{}\n\nTo introduce another characterization of regular variation on $\\bD$, we need to recall the definition of the modulus of continuity: for any $x \\in \\bD$ and $\\delta>0$, $$w(x,\\delta)=\\sup_{|s-t| \\leq \\delta}|x(s)-x(t)|.$$ If $x$ is continuous, then $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0}w(x,\\delta)=0$. In the case of a discontinuous function $x \\in \\bD$, the following quantity plays the same role as $w(x,\\delta)$: $$w''(x,\\delta)=\\sup_{t_1 \\leq t \\leq t_2, \\ t_2-t_1 \\leq \\delta} |x(t)-x(t_1)| \\wedge |x(t_2)-x(t)|,$$ since $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0}w''(x,\\delta)=0$ (see (14.8) and (14.46) of [@billingsley68]). We define $$w(x,T)=\\sup_{s,t \\in T}|x(s)-x(t)| \\quad \\mbox{for any set} \\ T \\subset [0,1].$$\n\nThe following result will be needed in the sequel. This result shows that the regular variation in $\\bD$ coincides with the regular variation of the marginal distributions, combined with some relative compactness conditions.\n\n\\[HL-theorem\\] Let $Z=\\{Z(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ be a process with sample paths in $\\bD$.

Lemma 4.3 of [@hult-samorod08] extends this result to a finite sum $X=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}A_j Z_j$, where $(Z_j)_j$ are i.i.d. regularly varying in $\\bR^d$, $(A_j)_j$ are random matrices with $E\\|A_j\\|^{\\alpha+\\gamma}<\\infty$ for some $\\gamma>0$, and $Z_j$ is independent of $(A_1, \\ldots,A_j,Z_1, \\ldots,Z_{j-1})$ for all $j$. (For the later result, one also needs the hypothesis $P(\\cup_{j=1}^{m}\\{\\|A_j\\|>0\\})>0$, which is missing from [@hult-samorod08].)\n\nOur first result is a version of Breiman’s lemma for processes with sample paths in $\\bD$.\n\n\\[product-lemma\\] Let $Z=\\{Z(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ and $\\Psi=\\{\\Psi(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ be independent processes with sample paths in $\\bD$ such that $Z \\in {\\rm RV}(\\{a_n\\},\\nu,\\barD_0)$, $\\Psi$ has continuous sample paths, and $E\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha+\\gamma}<\\infty$ for some $\\gamma>0$, where $\\alpha>0$ is the index of $Z$.

We show that $X$ satisfies the conditions of Theorem \\[HL-theorem\\].(ii) with $T_X=T \\cap T_1$ instead of $T$ and the measures $\\nu_{t_1, \\ldots,t_k}^X$ (defined by below) instead of $\\nu_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}$.\n\nFirst we show that $X$ satisfies condition (a). For this, let $t_1, \\ldots,t_k \\in T_X$ be arbitrary. Note that $(X(t_1), \\ldots,X(t_k))^T=AY$ where $A$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $\\Psi(t_1), \\ldots, \\Psi(t_k)$ and $Y=(Z(t_1),\\ldots,Z(t_k))^T$.

To justify the application of this proposition, we note that $E\\|A\\|^{\\alpha+\\gamma}\\leq E\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha+\\gamma}<\\infty$ and $E\\|A\\|^{\\alpha+\\gamma}>0$, where $\\|A\\|=\\max_{i \\leq k}|\\Psi(t_i)|$. (If $E\\|A\\|^{\\alpha+\\gamma}=0$ then $P(\\Psi(t_i)=0)=1$ for all $i\\leq k$, which contradicts .)\n\nWe now prove that the measure $\\nu^X$ given by has marginal measures $\\nu_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}^X$. For any $B \\in \\cB(\\barR_0^k)$, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}^{X}(B)&=&E[\\nu_{t_1, \\ldots,t_k}\\{x \\in \\bR^k;Ax \\in B \\cap \\bR^k\\}] \\\\\n&=& E[\\nu_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}\\{x\\in \\bR^k; (\\Psi(t_1)x_1,\\ldots,\\Psi(t_k)x_k) \\in B \\cap \\bR^k\\}] \\\\\n&=& E[\\nu\\{x \\in \\bD; (\\Psi(t_1)x(t_1),\\ldots,\\Psi(t_k)x(t_k)) \\in B \\cap \\bR^k\\}]\\\\\n&=& E[\\nu\\{x \\in \\bD; h_{\\Psi}(x) \\in \\{y \\in \\bD; (y(t_1),\\ldots,y(t_k)) \\in B \\cap \\bR^k \\}\\}] \\\\\n&=& \\nu^{X}\\{y \\in \\bD; (y(t_1),\\ldots,y(t_k)) \\in B \\cap \\bR^k\\}  \\\\\n&=& \\nu^{X}(\\pi_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}^{-1}(B \\cap \\bR^k))\\end{aligned}$$ using for the third equality and for the second last equality.\n\nNext we show that $X$ satisfies condition (b). We only prove (C1). Conditions (C2) and (C3) can be proved similarly. Let $\\varepsilon>0$ be arbitrary. If $w''(X,\\delta)> a_n \\varepsilon$ then there exist some $t_1\\leq t \\leq t_2$ with $t_2-t_1 \\leq \\delta$ such that $|X(t)-X(t_1)|>a_n\\varepsilon$ and $|X(t_2)-X(t)|>a_n \\varepsilon$. Since $$\\begin{aligned}\n|X(t)-X(t_1)| & \\leq & |Z(t)||\\Psi(t)-\\Psi(t_1)|+|\\Psi(t_1)||Z(t)-Z(t_1)| \\\\\n& \\leq & \\|Z\\|_{\\infty} |\\Psi(t)-\\Psi(t_1)|+\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}|Z(t)-Z(t_1)|,\\end{aligned}$$ it follows that $\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} |\\Psi(t)-\\Psi(t_1)|>a_n \\varepsilon/2$ or $\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}|Z(t)-Z(t_1)|> a_n \\varepsilon/2$. Similarly, $\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} |\\Psi(t_2)-\\Psi(t)|>a_n \\varepsilon/2$ or $\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}|Z(t_2)-Z(t)|> a_n \\varepsilon/2$. Hence $$\\begin{aligned}\nn P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon) & \\leq & n P(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} w''(\\Psi,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)+n P(\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)  \\\\\n& & +2nP(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty}w(\\Psi,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)\\\\\n&=:& P_{n,1}(\\delta)+P_{n,2}(\\delta)+P_{n,3}(\\delta).\\end{aligned}$$ We treat separately the three terms.\n\nFor the first term, we note that for any $\\theta>0$, $$P_{n,1}(\\delta)\n%& =& n P(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty},>a_n \\varepsilon/2,w''(\\Psi,\\delta) \\leq \\theta)+ n P(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} %w''(\\Psi,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2,w''(\\Psi,\\delta) > \\theta)\\\\\n \\leq\nn P(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} \\theta>a_n \\varepsilon/2)+ n P(\\|Z\\|_{\\infty} w''(\\Psi,\\delta)1_{\\{ w''(\\Psi,\\delta) >\\theta\\}}>a_n \\varepsilon/2).$$ We take the limit as $n\\to \\infty$. Using for the first term and Lemma \\[breiman-lemma-R\\] for the second term, we obtain that, for any $\\theta>0$, $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}P_{n,1}(\\delta) \\leq c (\\varepsilon/2)^{-\\alpha}\\theta^{\\alpha}+c(\\varepsilon/2)^{-\\alpha}\nE[w''(\\Psi,\\delta)^{\\alpha}1_{\\{w''(\\Psi,\\delta)>\\theta\\}}].$$ Taking $\\theta \\to 0$, we obtain that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}P_{n,1}(\\delta) \\leq c(\\varepsilon/2)^{-\\alpha}\nE[w''(\\Psi,\\delta)^{\\alpha}]$. Take the limit as $\\delta \\to 0$. By the dominated convergence theorem, $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0}E[w''(\\Psi,\\delta)^{\\alpha}]=0$, since $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0}w''(\\Psi,\\delta)=0$ and $w''(\\Psi,\\delta) \\leq 2 \\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}$. Hence $$\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}P_{n,1}(\\delta)=0.$$\n\nFor the second term, we denote by $P_{\\Psi}$ the law of $\\Psi$ on $\\bD$. Since $Z$ and $\\Psi$ are independent, we have: $$P_{n,2}(\\delta)=\\int_{\\bD} n P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)  P_{\\Psi}(d\\psi).$$ Using Lemma \\[pratt-lemma\\] (Appendix A), we infer that: $$\\label{ineq-prod}\n\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} P_{n,2}(\\delta) \\leq \\int_{\\bD} \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}\nn P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)  P_{\\Psi}(d\\psi).$$ To justify the application of this lemma, we note that $$f_n(\\psi):=n P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)  \\leq g_n(\\psi):=nP(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty}\\|Z\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\varepsilon/4),$$ $g_n(\\psi) \\to g(\\psi):=c (\\varepsilon/4)^{-\\alpha}\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha}$ (due to ) and $$\\int_{\\bD}g_n(\\psi)P_{\\Psi}(d\\psi)=nP(\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty} \\|Z\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\varepsilon/4) \\to c(\\varepsilon/4)^{-\\alpha}E\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha}=\\int_{\\bD}g(\\psi)P_{\\Psi}(d\\psi),$$ by Lemma \\[breiman-lemma-R\\]. (Note that $\\|Z\\|_{\\infty}$ is regularly varying, and implies that $P(\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}>0)>0$, which forces $E\\|\\Psi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha+\\gamma}>0$.)\n\nWe now take the limit as $\\delta \\to 0$ in . We apply again Lemma \\[pratt-lemma\\] to interchange the limit with the integral. (Both terms are increasing functions of $\\delta$, so the limit as $\\delta \\to 0$ exists.) Since $Z$ is regularly varying, $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\limsup_{n}n P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2)=0$ for any $\\psi \\in \\bD$, and hence $$\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}P_{n,2}(\\delta)=0.$$ This second application of Lemma \\[pratt-lemma\\] is justified by the fact that $F_{\\delta}(\\psi):=\\limsup_n n P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} w''(Z,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon/2) \\leq \\limsup_n n P(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\infty} \\|Z\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\varepsilon/4):=G(\\psi)$ which does not depend on $\\delta$.\n\nIt remains to treat the third term. Since $\\Psi$ has continuous sample paths, $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} w(\\Psi,\\delta)=0$, and this term is treated exactly as the first term. $\\Box$\n\nWe now consider a finite sum of product terms as in the previous lemma.\n\n\\[sum-lemma\\] Let $Z_j=\\{Z_j(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]},j=1,\\ldots,m$ be i.i.d. processes with sample paths in $\\bD$ such that $Z_1 \\in {\\rm RV}(\\{a_n\\},\\nu,\\barD_0)$ and $\\alpha>0$ be the index of $Z_1$.

The fact that the measure $\\nu^X$ given by has the marginal measures $\\nu_{t_1,\\ldots,t_k}^X$ follows as in the case $m=1$ (see the proof of Lemma \\[product-lemma\\]). We omit the details.\n\nNext we show that $X$ satisfies condition (b). We only prove (C1). Conditions (C2) and (C3) can be proved by similar methods.\n\nTo simplify the notation, we assume that $m=2$. The general result can be proved similarly. Let $\\varepsilon>0$ and $\\theta>0$ be arbitrary. As in the proof of Lemma 5.1 of [@davis-mikosch08], we use the decomposition: $$\\begin{aligned}\nn P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon) & = & n P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon,\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2 \\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta)\\\\\n& + & n P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon,\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2 \\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n \\theta) \\\\\n&+&n P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon,\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n \\theta,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2 \\|_{\\infty} > a_n \\theta) \\\\\n&+& n P(w''(X,\\delta)>a_n \\varepsilon,\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty}\\leq a_n \\theta,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2 \\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n \\theta)\\\\\n&:=& P_{n,1}(\\delta)+ P_{n,2}(\\delta)+ P_{n,3}(\\delta)+ P_{n,4}(\\delta).\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe treat separately the four terms.

We denote by $P_{\\Psi_1,\\Psi_2,Z_1}$ the law of $(\\Psi_1,\\Psi_2,Z_1)$. Using the independence between $(\\Psi_1,\\Psi_2,Z_1)$ and $Z_2$, we have: $$\\begin{aligned}\nP_{n,1}(\\delta) &\\leq & n P(\\|\\Psi_1\\|_{\\infty}\\|Z_1\\|_{\\infty}>a_n\\theta, \\|\\Psi_2\\|_{\\infty}\\|Z_2\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta)\\\\\n&=& \\int_{\\bD^3} f_n(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,z_1) dP_{\\Psi_1,\\Psi_2,Z_1}(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,z_1).\\end{aligned}$$ where $f_n(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,z_1)=n1_{\\{\\|\\psi_1\\|_{\\infty}\\|z_1\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta\\}} P(\\|\\psi_2\\|_{\\infty}\\|Z_2\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\theta) \\to 0$.

Hence, $$\\begin{aligned}\nP_{n,2}(\\delta) & \\leq & n P(w''(\\Psi_1 Z_1,\\delta)+2\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2 \\|_{\\infty}>a_n\\varepsilon,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2\\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n \\theta) \\\\\n& \\leq & n P(w''(\\Psi_1 Z_1,\\delta)>a_n(\\varepsilon-2\\theta)).\\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, if $\\theta<\\varepsilon/2$, then by Lemma \\[product-lemma\\], $$\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0}\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}P_{n,2}(\\delta) \\leq \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}nP(w''(\\Psi_1 Z_1,\\delta)>a_n(\\varepsilon-2\\theta))=0.$$\n\nThe third term is similar to the second term. For the fourth term, we use the fact that $w''(x+y, \\delta) \\leq 2\\|x+y\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 2(\\|x\\|_{\\infty}+\\|y\\|_{\\infty})$ and hence, $$P_{n,4}(\\delta) \\leq n P(\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty}+\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2\\|_{\\infty}>a_n \\varepsilon/2,\\|\\Psi_1 Z_1\\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n\\theta,\\|\\Psi_2 Z_2\\|_{\\infty} \\leq a_n \\theta).$$ The last probability is 0 if $\\theta<\\varepsilon/4$. The conclusion follows. $\\Box$\n\n[**Proof of Theorem \\[RV-infinite-sum\\]:**]{} [*Step 1.*]{} We show that with probability 1, the series $X(t)$ converges for any $t \\in [0,1]$, and the process $X=\\{X(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ has sample paths in $\\bD$.

By Proposition A2.6.II of [@D-VJ], this is equivalent to showing that: $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}nE[f(T(a_n^{-1}X))] = \\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^X(du),$$ for any bounded continuous function $f:\\barD_0 \\to \\bR$ which vanishes outside a bounded set. Let $f$ be such a function. Suppose that $f$ vanishes outside a set $(r,\\infty] \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$ for some $r>0$, and $|f(u)| \\leq K$ for all $u \\in \\barD_0$.\n\nBy Lemma \\[sum-lemma\\], we know that for $m$ large enough (for which holds), $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}nE[f(T(a_n^{-1}X^{(m)}))] =\\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^{(m)}(du)$$ where $\\mu^{(m)}=\\nu^{(m)} \\circ T^{-1}$ on $(0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}$, with $\\nu^{(m)}(\\cdot)=E[\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\nu \\circ h_{\\Psi_j}^{-1}(\\cdot)]$, and $\\mu^{(m)}(\\{\\infty\\} \\times \\bS_{\\bD})=0$. We claim that $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty}\\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^{(m)}(du)=\\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^X(du).$$ To see this, note that for any bounded measurable function $g:\\bD_0 \\to \\bR$, $$\\int_{\\bD_0} g(x)\\nu^{X}(dx)=\\sum_{j \\geq 1}\\int_{\\Omega}\\int_{\\bD_0} g(\\Psi_j(\\omega)y)\\nu(dy)P(d\\omega).$$ Hence $$\\int_{\\barD_0}f(u)\\mu^{X}(du)=\n%\\int_{(0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}}f(u)\\mu^{X}(du)=\n\\int_{\\bD_0}f(T(x))\\nu^{X}(dx)=\\sum_{j \\geq 1}\\int_{\\Omega}\\int_{\\bD_0} f(T(\\Psi_j(\\omega)y))\\nu(dy)P(d\\omega).$$ Similarly, $$\\int_{\\barD_0}f(u)\\mu^{(m)}(du)=\n%\\int_{(0,\\infty) \\times \\bS_{\\bD}}f(u)\\mu^{X}(du)=\n\\int_{\\bD_0}f(T(x))\\nu^{(m)}(dx)=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\int_{\\Omega}\\int_{\\bD_0} f(T(\\Psi_j(\\omega)y))\\nu(dy)P(d\\omega),$$ and therefore, $$\\begin{aligned}\n& & \\left|\\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^{(m)}(du)-\\int_{\\barD_0} f(u) \\mu^X(du)\\right|\\leq  \\sum_{j \\geq m+1} \\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\bD_0} |f(T(\\Psi_j(\\omega) y))|\\nu(dy) P(d\\omega) \\\\\n& & \\leq K \\sum_{j \\geq m+1} \\int_{\\Omega}\\nu(\\{x \\in \\bD_0; \\|\\Psi_j(\\omega)\\|_{\\infty}\\|x\\|_{\\infty}>r\\}) P(d\\omega) \\\\\n& & = K \\sum_{j \\geq m+1} \\int_{\\Omega} c\\left(\\frac{r}{\\|\\Psi_j(\\omega)\\|_{\\infty}}\\right)^{-\\alpha}\n1_{\\{\\|\\Psi_j(\\omega)\\|_{\\infty}>0\\}}P(d\\omega)\\\\\n& & = K c r^{-\\alpha}\\sum_{j \\geq m+1}E\\|\\Psi_j\\|_{\\infty}^{\\alpha} \\to 0 \\quad \\mbox{as} \\ m \\to \\infty,\\end{aligned}$$ using for the first equality above. It remains to prove that: $$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty}\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} n E|f(T(a_n^{-1}X))-f(T(a_n^{-1}X^{(m)}))|=0.$$ This can be proved similarly to (5.3) of [@davis-mikosch08], using Lemma \\[sum-lemma\\] above and Theorem 3.1 of [@hult-samorod08]. We omit the details. $\\Box$\n\nInterchanging limsup with an integral\n=====================================\n\nPratt’s lemma is a useful tool which allows interchanging a limit with an integral (see [@pratt60]). In the present article, we need the following version of Pratt’s lemma.\n\n\\[pratt-lemma\\] Let $(f_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ and $(g_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ be some measurable functions defined on a measure space $(E,\\cE,\\mu)$ such that $0 \\leq f_n \\leq g_n$ for any $n$, $g_n \\to g$ and $$\\label{pratt-cond}\n\\int_E g_n d\\mu \\to \\int_E g  d\\mu<\\infty.$$ Then $$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_E f_n d\\mu \\leq \\int_E \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}f_nd\\mu.$$\n\n[**Proof:**]{} By Fatou’s lemma, $\\int \\liminf_n(g_n-f_n)d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_n \\int (g_n-f_n)d\\mu$. By , $g_n$ (and $f_n$) are integrable for $n$ large enough, and $\\limsup_n f_n$ is also integrable (being bounded by $g$). Hence, the previous inequality becomes: $$\\int_E gd\\mu-\\int_E \\limsup_n f_n d\\mu \\leq \\liminf_n \\int_E g_n d\\mu-\\limsup_n \\int_E f_n d\\mu.$$ The conclusion follows by .$\\Box$\n\n[99]{}\n\nAstrauskas, A.

{"text": "Back Pain – There is Good News\n\nThe bad news is you may have or know someone that is experiencing chronic or persistent back pain. The good news is, there is a way forward.\n\nYesterday, three important papers about back pain published in the Lancet (one of the world’s oldest and best known general medical journals) were referenced in the The Guardian, The Telegraph, the BBC News and the Daily Mail . So current evidence-based information, at last, making its way to the public domain.\n\nIn briefly reviewing the papers (published March 21, 2018), the key points for me are these:\n\n“Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide.\n\n“Prevention of the onset and persistence of disability associated with low back pain requires recognition that the disability is inseparable from the social and economic context of people’s lives and is entwined with personal and cultural beliefs about back pain.”\n\n“Globally, gaps between evidence and practice exist, with limited use of recommended first-line treatments and inappropriately high use of imaging, rest, opioids, spinal injections, and surgery. Doing more of the same will not reduce back-related disability or its long-term consequences.”\n\n“Recommendations include use of a biopsychosocial framework to guide management with initial nonpharmacological treatment, including education that supports self-management and resumption of normal activities and exercise,…”\n\nThank goodness this is getting the attention it deserves so it can help people who need it most. And that’s a LOT OF PEOPLE.\n\nWhy now, finally? I think it’s gaining traction due to spiraling health care costs along with the opioid crisis that is so prevalent.\n\nOver the next while I’m going to break down and comment upon some of the points and principles presented in the papers, as many form the basis of my work. In the meantime, if you care to read the papers yourself they can be found here.\n\nLorimer Moseley, one of the world’s top researchers on pain continues to make the related point that people need an understanding of what pain is and what it isn’t, as he does with a touch of humor in his TEDx Talk in 2011. Professor Moseley is most known, however, for publishing 260+ papers on pain science and his continued work as Professor of Clinical Neurosciences and Chair of Physiotherapy at the University of South Australia.And one of many leading the charge globally in what he calls a Pain Revolution.\n\nA huge paradigm shift is required as understandably, information about what works to treat back pain and what doesn’t is confusing. It seems counter-intuitive to ask people who are in pain to ‘just move more”. As the latest interviews I’ve listened in to with Lorimer, he states that with what we’ve learned ‘recovery is, back on the table’. There is hope. As I mentioned earlier, there is a way forward.\n\nI talk about this all the time with family and friends … who often have a hard time believing what I describe as it is a change from what we have believed for most of our lifetime.\n\nBut, if we really truly want to get people out of this pain cycle (and I will say most any pain cycle) we need to help with the understanding of what the evidence shows and how to best work with it. This will also require huge shifts in our public policy, etc. as stated in the Lancet papers.\n\n“These potential solutions include focused strategies to implement best practice, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health and occupational interventions to reduce work disability, changes in compensation and disability claims policies, and public health and prevention strategies.”\n\nSo come along for the ride if you or anyone you know is experiencing chronic or persistent low back pain (or any pain, really). With 1 in 5 experiencing chronic pain of some kind, unfortunately, you won’t have to look too far.\n\nRecent Posts\n\nWeb Sessions\n\nAs long as I can see you move, we can work together.

{"text": "Q:\n\nHow to create a new instance from a class object in Python\n\nI need to dynamically create an instance of a class in Python. Basically I am using the load_module and inspect module to import and load the class into a class object, but I can't figure out how to create an instance of this class object.\nPlease help!\n\nA:\n\nI figured out the answer to the question I had that brought me to this page.  Since no one has actually suggested the answer to my question, I thought I'd post it.\nclass k:\n  pass\n\na = k()\nk2 = a.__class__\na2 = k2()\n\nAt this point, a and a2 are both instances of the same class (class k).\n\nA:\n\nJust call the \"type\" built in using three parameters, like this:\nClassName = type(\"ClassName\", (Base1, Base2,...), classdictionary)\n\nupdate \nas stated in the comment bellow this is not the answer to this question at all. I will keep it undeleted, since there are hints some people  get here  trying to dynamically create classes - which is what the line above does.\nTo create an object of a class one has a reference too, as put in the accepted answer, one just have to call the class:\ninstance = ClassObject()\n\nThe mechanism for instantiation is thus:\nPython does not use the new keyword some languages use - instead it's data model explains the mechanism used to create an instantance of a class when it is called with the same syntax as any other callable:\nIts class' __call__ method is invoked (in the case of a class, its class is the \"metaclass\" - which is usually the built-in type). The normal behavior of this call is to invoke the (pseudo) static __new__ method on the class being instantiated, followed by its __init__. The __new__ method is responsible for allocating memory and such, and normally is done by the __new__ of object which is the class hierarchy root.\nSo calling ClassObject() invokes ClassObject.__class__.call() (which normally will be type.__call__) this __call__ method will receive ClassObject itself as the first parameter - a Pure Python implementation would be like this: (the cPython version is of course, done in C, and with lots of extra code for cornercases and optimizations)\nclass type:\n    ...\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kw):\n          constructor = getattr(cls, \"__new__\")\n          instance = constructor(cls) if constructor is object.__new__ else constructor(cls, *args, **kw)\n          instance.__init__(cls, *args, **kw)\n          return instance\n\n(I don't recall seeing on the docs the exact justification (or mechanism) for suppressing extra parameters to the root __new__ and passing it to other classes - but it is what happen \"in real life\" - if object.__new__ is called with any extra parameters it raises a type error - however, any custom implementation of a __new__ will get the extra parameters normally) \n\nA:\n\nThis is how you can dynamically create a class named Child in your code, assuming Parent already exists... even if you don't have an explicit Parent class, you could use object...\nThe code below defines __init__() and then associates it with the class.\n>>> child_name = \"Child\"\n>>> child_parents = (Parent,)\n>>> child body = \"\"\"\ndef __init__(self, arg1):\n    # Initialization for the Child class\n    self.foo = do_something(arg1)\n\"\"\"\n>>> child_dict = {}\n>>> exec(child_body, globals(), child_dict)\n>>> childobj = type(child_name, child_parents, child_dict)\n>>> childobj.__name__\n'Child'\n>>> childobj.__bases__\n(<type 'object'>,)\n>>> # Instantiating the new Child object...\n>>> childinst = childobj()\n>>> childinst\n<__main__.Child object at 0x1c91710>\n>>>\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "How battle-ready is India for a War against China or Pakistan?\n\nThere is bad news for those Facebook warriors eager for a war with China and Pakistan. The report that the country’s Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has submitted to Parliament about the Indian army has some significantly disturbing findings. Despite all its bravery, our army is battling with a drastic shortfall of necessary ammunition.\n\nThe report is a follow-up to the conclusions of May 2015. Its objective was to evaluate the progress that has been made over the last three years. The CAG report on ammunition management reveals that the situation in September 2016 has not changed very much since March 2013.\n\nThe reason? Our ordnance factories have not improved their output or quality and the procurement process continues to run on the old pattern. The wishlist of weaponry that the army headquarters wanted to acquire which was on the government’s files had not been fulfilled even till January 2017.\n\nThe CAG report also says that of the 170 kinds of ammunition in 2013, just 27% was ready for 20 days of intense fighting, while in September 2016, 80% ammunition was below the required levels. The situation has improved only marginally in the months that followed. The government has given the rights for procurement to the vice-chief of the army staff in the event of an emergency. With this, the risk has reduced but it hasn’t entirely vanished.\n\nIn this situation the question that comes to one’s mind is whether the government has set a standard where it should have a minimum level of arsenal and associated ammunition? The ministry of defence had devised a roadmap in 2013 according to which it had to procure 20 days of ammunition that was necessary to win a small-scale war, by 2015. It was also decided that these supplies would be increased to 40 days by 2019 so that we can prepare for bigger battles. Both these plans are hanging fire.\n\nEven the best marksman and commando can forget his craft without adequate practice. According to this report, the army has had to cut down on its training drills in light of the shortage of essential resources. The shortfall in resources required for training is between 77% and 88%. Can you imagine any country winning a war without the requisite ammunition and training?\n\nThe situation continues to be so bad despite facing the repercussions of such shortfalls during the war with China in 1962. Even then, our soldiers were neither equipped with the requisite weapons, nor maps that are essential in the dangerous mountainous terrain.\n\nWe may have won the Kargil war in 1999, but at what cost? At the end of Operation Vijay, the shoulders of the Indian nation-state were drooping with the burden of 537 martyrs. Even during this war the shortfall of essential ammunition had been revealed. When the initial group of soldiers tried to scale the high peaks, they didn’t have the requisite clothes and shoes required for snow-bound terrain. This has been the sorry picture of our military affairs from 1962 to 1999. Who should be held accountable for this mess?\n\nWith utmost humility, I hold the nation’s political class responsible for this. The manner in which the Bofors ghost was invoked and then used to pursue selfish political goals for years together instilled terror in Delhi’s political corridors. Politicians began to be reluctant to buy the ammunition essential for the army and an issue critical to the nation’s security was pushed into the background.\n\nThe time has come when our politicians should stop the mud-slinging and create a consensus on subjects of national interest. Just because our soldiers are not afraid of making the greatest sacrifice, none of us have a right to push them into the jaws of death. On July 26 this year, in the memory of Operation Vijay, the people organised a number of events and sang patriotic songs. But how many of those participating in this group were perturbed over the findings of the CAG report?\n\nThe country’s foreign and military policy should be guided by facts, not emotions. When we chose a government, we should also allow it to work. The government in Delhi these days displays adequate sensitivity towards our soldiers on international borders. You may recall that Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent last Diwali with the soldiers guarding our borders. The defence ministry is being led by the sharp and astute Arun Jaitley. We sincerely hope that the duo gets rid of this old malaise afflicting the country.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Monthly Archives: September 2012\n\nThe article below is a very indepth response to a freerange post from last year, written by Beale Stainton on his site The Bealian. Beale has kindly given us permission to re-post his article here. To quickly summarise: I wrote an article about the philosophical/economic difference between the ‘left’ and ‘right’ where the left sees full employment and its consequences as the desirable goal, and the right sees low inflation and its consequences as the desirable goal. I suggest that the right accepts that a certain amount of unemployment is good for the country, in that it keeps inflation down, but then it becomes nasty when it attacks the unemployed for being lazy, a drain on the country, etc, when in fact they are, in this model, making a sacrifice that we all gain from. Beale has responded with a very informative description of the economic demands on government and what they are and aren’t able to control, suggesting that employment is largely outside of the scope of the government to control.\n\nSTART\n\nThe following analysis is in response to an article published by the good folk over at Project Freerange entitled “The nastiness of the mainstream right politics”, which you can read by clicking on the link here.\n\nThis article argues that there is a fundamental difference between economic policy of the left and that of the right in New Zealand politics. A press release of Michael Cullen’s policy back in 2002 aimed at, among other things, the creation of full employment. The 2008 press release given by Bill English on the other hand does not make a mention to employment at all. This is a very salient observation that has been made. The Freerange article goes on to then link the employment negligent economic policy of the right with inflation. It is argued that right wing policy aims to keep unemployment high for the purposes of controlling inflation. Now we all know that Government policy is conducted with the purposes of engineering some greater master plan. The question that this raises is how far would a particular government be willing to go in order to control inflation? Would they purposefully keep employment rates down?\n\nNow, I have written this article for two reasons. The first reason is, because I wanted to return a constructive and critical response to Barnaby at Freerange. The second reason is to show the world what the insides of a governments books look like. In regard to the first reason I will attempt to build upon Barnaby’s valiant attempt at an economic argument. It does indeed appear as if employment levels could be engineered in order to control inflation.\n\nThe current National Government has been, for the most part, conducting itself in a fashion, which it can be argued, goes completely against the unwritten rules of civilized public relations. They have, through their overly assertive reforms, taken very few prisoners, if any. They have, time and again, come up against mass public opposition to their policies. They have expressed a certain culture of authoritarian disregard so to speak, perhaps an arrogance even. In the opinion of many in our country they have quite simply been rubbing people up the wrong way. They perhaps have contributed to further backlash by the mere fact that their leader gained the nick name “Smiling Assassin” while employed as head of foreign exchange dealings at international banking powerhouse Merrill Lynch. He earned this nick name, because he continued to smile while making some hundreds of redundancies in the wake of the 1998 Russian Financial Crisis. It is no wonder that there is a certain air of mistrust and disillusionment coming from various parts of New Zealand society.\n\nFor this reason I hope I can lay down a few reasons as to why such policy has been implemented. I would like to start off by saying that, in my opinion, this is not so much a matter of left or right wing. For example, the former Minister of Finance under the Helen Clark Government, Michael Cullen has a past life and so does Helen Clark herself for that matter. If you go back in history to the Labour Government of 1984-1990. You will find an up and coming Cullen in the position of Associate Finance Minister plotting away in the shadow of Roger Douglas, the prophet of the New Right. So it can be argued that Michael Cullen himself contributed to the genesis of the policies of the New Right in this country. In my opinion Government policy is, for the most part, reactive rather than proactive. Muldoon’s National Government was forced into extreme national protectionism and regulation by way of reaction. Lange’s Labour Government was then forced to go extremely open and in pursuit of the free market by way of reaction. Helen Clark’s Labour Government, post 2001, was the lucky one, because it got to react to good economic times. It was lucky, because as a result of the success generated on the international free market it was able to oversee a speculative rise in property, financing and construction, which like Spain and Ireland brought a lot of money and jobs into the economy. 2001 was also the defining year for New Zealand in that China joined the WTO and Fonterra was established. If you want to get a grip on why things are so in New Zealand at the moment then we only need to take a look at Spain, Ireland and many other parts of the world that too heavily depended on property, finance and construction to fuel their economies.\n\nAnyway let’s move on.\n\nThe next point I would like to make is that there is not much a Government can do to keep unemployment low. It can, to a certain degree, in the case where a Government employs a lot of people. The Government would only need to lay off a required number of civil servants in order to meet a certain measure for the purpose of meeting a particular target percentage of unemployment. The National Government has in deed been doing this, however this has been done for other reasons, which I will get to later. In the private sector, demand for labour is unregulated. When the private sector needs labour it simply takes it. This is what happens when an economy is picking up. When it is slower then the private sector doesn’t so much demand labour and so unemployment increases. As I’ve stated. This is an unregulated market Government cannot interfere with.\n\nAnother point of criticism I would like to make is in regard to the correlation between employment and inflation. The man who officially argued the connection was the New Zealand born economist William Phillips. He has, as a result, left to the world the “Phillips curve”, which states that when unemployment is high then inflation is low and vice versa. This is evidently so, because as unemployment increases the supply of money decreases and therefore producers will be forced to put their prices down. However Phillips argument was based only on research done in the United Kingdom between 1861-1957. It has been apparently disproved by the many economies which have both high inflation and high employment. However I would only take the rebuttal theories with a grain of salt, simply because they are argued first and foremost by Milton Friedman. I’ve looked at Friedman’sstagflation theory and to be honest with you all, it stinks. It stinks of the modern financial system and perspective engineering.\n\nFriedman’s stagnation theory argues that when unemployment lowers this triggers a rise in wages and a rise in wages eventually means that unemployment will return to its previously higher level, so far correct, but then he goes onto say that inflation will remain high. This is how the Phillips curve was disproved and forced to give way to Friedman’s theory ofstagflation. Philips argued that inflation would eventually reduce too. Now in pure theory, I’m going to go with Philips on this one, because in a self-regulating market, producers would bring their prices down to match the reduced supply of money in a high unemployment economy. However we no longer live in a self-regulating market. We now live in a market regulated by financial systems and the domination of credit. If cross border credit didn’t exist then the pure theory of Phillips would prevail, but in a world where cross border credit is the main regulating force behind an economy then it is sadly Friedman’s version of events that will prevail. What I have just discovered is actually quite brilliant and deserves to be written into a doctorate. Anyway, I’ll come back to that in my own time. We need to move on.\n\nSo there we have it Barnaby and others. I have successfully altered the direction I was sending this article. Friedman, being the worshiped economist that he is, was meant to be right and then I was going to proceed to make my final points. However I’ve just proven him wrong and as a consequence, my further points wrong. Or have I? Perhaps I am still on the right track.\n\nLet me just state that the reason unemployment is high at the moment is not so much due to a political engineering campaign by the National Government to keep inflation steady. Employment is high, because there is a whole bunch of debt to pay off. This situation has in effect squeezed the life blood out of the economy. The situation is complicated, but I will try my best to explain it.\n\nGovernment is not something that renews itself every three years. It is an ongoing entity. All that changes is the party or the leadership voted in to manage and direct it. Debts and surpluses incurred by one government will be inherited by the next and so on. In the same way, long term debts incurred now, let’s say in the form of a 10 or 30-year bond issuance, will be paid off by future tax payers in 10 or 30 years time and not the current ones. The current taxpayers reap the benefits, so to speak, for what their children will be forced to pay off.\n\nNow let’s look closer at Government. It is such a beautiful monstrosity. Government has revenues and costs just like any enterprise, whether that be yourself, the corner dairy, Telecom or whatever. As such, just like most other enterprises, it needs to prepare a number of statements and plans. Let’s start with the statements. The first statement is the “Statement of Financial Performance”. This statement records its revenue against its expenses. The next statement is the “Statement of Financial Position”. This one records what it owns against what it owes. The third is the “Cash Flow Statement”. Now this one is fairly self evident. Now the important thing to note is that what appears in these statements, generally becomes the basis for preparing the next very important document. That next document is the “Budget”.\n\nIt is likely that bad news in the 3 above statements over a period of previous years will most likely contribute to the publication of a bad news “Budget” for subsequent years. The “Budget” then gets translated into policy and policy gets translated into execution, which is the responsibility of the party in power. So hopefully the chain is now obvious. Bad news in the statements, will lead to bad news in the budget and subsequent bad news in policy and as a result, in execution.\n\nNow, as a result of the sudden contraction in the global economy, the private sector took one hell of a hit. Let’s not go into too much detail. It was a bust. A bust is a cataclysmic event and everyone gets hurt. Even Berkshire Hathaway stocks went from $150,000 a pop down to $60,000. A raging private sector is fueled by a need for two things. It needs labour and capital, the two main inputs of business. The banks provide the capital and the people the labour. As such, capital and debt markets boom and unemployment drops. As a result Governments will receive more taxes and spend less and Reserve Banks will lift interest rates to keep inflation steady. Up until 2008 the NZ Reserve Bank had the OCR, the primary interest rate of the economy, set at above 8%. At the moment it is down at 2.5%.\n\nWhen the private sector is booming there is money left, right and centre, which means prices will go up causing inflation. Reserve Banks react by lifting interest rates so that people get enticed by the returns to be made simply by putting their money into Government securities. This takes money out of the economy and keeps inflation steady. When economies are stagnant like now then Reserve Banks react by lowering interest rates making it cheaper to borrow and thus causing an inflationary effect of sorts. However this gets countered by the lack of economic activity and therefore money. What I want to describe to you in the boom picture, which lasted from 2001-2008 is how easy the Labour Government had it for that time period. There was absolutely no need for austere measures. Their Reserve Bank needed to do the opposite and reduce the amount of money. They were lucky the private sector was booming, takes the weight off their shoulders.\n\nSince 2008 and the arrival of National, Government experienced a reversal. Their revenues decreased and their expenses increased. This was a direct result of the bust, not the arrival of National in and of itself. Remember this is the same Government as always, just under new management. Not only did tax revenue fall, but the taxpayer had to bail out the broken economy putting further pressure on spending. As a result the weight got put on the shoulders of Government. In the performance statement of 2009 there was a surplus between revenue and expenditure, but an overall decrease from 2008. In the performance statement of 2010 there was a deficit of 2.1%, by 2011 a deficit of 3.3% and this year a deficit of 8.4%. The large deficit recorded this year was mostly a result of an increase in the “insurance expense” column between 2010 and 2011 of some $8 billion. It’s all recorded in the books.\n\nNow what these widening deficits do is they force Governments to draw up budgets and policies which will cause a good deal of pain and frustration when they are executed. Think about it. If you record a 2.1% deficit this means that the budget for next year is going to come down to either one or two options. The first is to adjust income or expenses. The second is to put down a bond issuance and borrow in order to cover your costs for the next year. The second move means that you need to borrow now, but as a result, future tax payers will be hit with the bill. Not only that but your credit rating could be effected, which means that the cost of borrowing money next year will go up. This means that you will hit the pockets of future tax payers even more. Borrowing more also means that you are creating more expenses. These expenses get recorded in the books as “interest expenses”. The more debt you take on the higher this expense column climbs. This will likely increase your deficit even more. As a result it is best to resort to the first option than to resort to the second one. There is a third option. You can sell some assets, but we go into that.\n\nSo the first option is what governments will resort to. They can increase revenue by hiking tax rates. However this move is further bad news for the economy. What they should do is increase taxes on mega profits, however this move causes big business to kick up a fuss and threaten the government with relocation to another part of the world or some other form of rebellion. This eventuates into further bad news for the economy. What the current government is doing is they are looking at other sources of national income such as the taxes and royalties generated by mining operations and other economic operations in the long run. On the other side there needs to be a reduction in spending. This is evident by the reduction in staff in the public services, a lowering of the teacher to student ratio and a tightening up of welfare services. For the record, social security and welfare currently costs the Government $2 billion a month. Education and Healthcare both come in at $1 billion a month, only half that of welfare, but in times like this the welfare is needed. These three cost centres out shadow all others. It’s all there in the books.\n\nSo I hope I have explained how increasing deficits and spiraling debt forces reactive governance. It is usually the Finance Minister, who is also the automatic Treasurer, who holds the purse strings. It is their responsibility, in their role, to create a long term plan, in this case a three year or five year one, to get the books back into surplus. In order to do this the Treasurer needs to sit in his office, study the statements and a whole host of other reported information from his departments and as a result draw up, to begin with, a budget. The budget will most likely be produced, in a time of deficit, so as to reduce expenses and suggest increases in revenue sources, without needing to borrow too much. The budget is then communicated through to ministers. They will be told that they need to cut spending by such an amount. The minister will then set about turning the expenditure reductions into policy. The policy will be communicated to the public and, in a time of forced fiscal austerity, they will not react too kindly to it. The appropriate ministries will then set about executing policy.\n\nBudgets are limited, but relatively precise in that they only look upon the next financial year. The next level of planning is what is known as the strategy. Strategies look over periods of three to five to ten years. They cannot be as precise in their financial estimations and therefore provide only rough projections of future Government revenues and expenditures over, let’s say, a five or ten year period. They provide direction more than anything. For example, the Petroleum Action Strategy of 2009 estimated that the mining of New Zealand’s minerals reserves could turn a $3 billion per annum industry into a $30 billion per annum industry by the year 2025. As such Government would be set to earn from both taxes and royalties and the economy will be boosted. Now we know that these figures are such an extreme estimation, but they at least provide guidelines to get the ball rolling, develop policy and debate the costs.\n\nThe sale of state assets is also set out in a strategy as opposed to budget. The financial return on the assets will be estimated from, for the most part, an uncertain future. The estimated return for example might come to $10 billion over four years. This $10 billion will then be calculated into an estimated budget and performance scenario of Government four years into the future. The Treasurer will then make a rough estimation and let’s say he concludes that Government will be back in surplus in four years time provided all policies and strategies have been successfully executed. He will no doubt in include margins of risk to strengthen the estimations. If the figures add up then Government will go about putting plans into action and when the chain is a result of bad news inputs, like they are at the moment, then there will be bad news outputs.\n\nSo there we go everyone. This is how austere governance works. Perhaps, after writing this, I now feel quite austere myself. My main argument is that austere measurements, just like liberal ones are a result of reaction to a given economic environment. It does not matter if you have a Labour or National party in power. The boom of 2001-2008 allowed Labour to be liberal, but the dire economic situation of 1984 forced the then Labour Government to be austere and same with Muldoon. My other argument is that keeping unemployment low is not so much a tool Governments use to control inflation. If the private sector needs labour then there is nothing Government can do to stop this. Labour is controlled by the market. High unemployment usually means that the private sector is not demanding so much or that Government itself is forced to cut back on spending to reduce its deficits. On the other hand there is a correlation between unemployment and inflation, which Friedman denied, but as I showed you guys I suspect Friedman’s theory of being subject to a regulating factor and that is cross border credit. Therefore his theory of stagflation should not qualify as pure economics and the Phillips curve should be given its rightful position at the top again. My final argument is that austere and unpopular policies and executive consequence are the result of bad finances caused by external economic conditions. This is evident by the way continuing deficits, as a result of a bust, causes certain reactive policies to bring the books back into the black without having to borrow too much.\n\nThat is where I will finish. Barnaby I certainly enjoyed reading your article and, as has been obviously displayed, it did make me think a great deal in order to give you a response you can seriously consider, warts and all, not the pretty picture anyone wants. Monetary and fiscal policy, when the going gets tough, is not a place for the faint of heart. However I will leave with a final thought. What I have given you is my honest description as a result of my education and research. Austere governance is austere governance. There are no two ways about that. It has its place and its time. The power and influence of fiat money or credit creation on the other hand is a whole completely different set of bad news. This system likes to pretend that it acts in the interests of deregulating economies, but the truth of the matter is that it has itself and is fast becoming, the ultimate and central power of regulation. In this sense it is now the state being regulated. There has been a fundamental shift in power and dominance. Think about that for a second and the consequences it spells for the future of economy and government. They will both be locked into cycles of boom, fueled by credit creation and cycles of bust, fueled by credit crunches, which Governments will be forced into taking the rap for. It is the simple system of credit, which is what we need to look out for. This is a game John Key and the rest of us are all pawns in. It is a system people like Friedman have argued into the academic literature as being the way it is. This is something I can’t quite grasp without speculating and making up conspiracy theories. So for the moment it is best we keep silent about it and only think on it.\n\nIn 2007, Dr Peter Wood (aka P-Dubs), Senior Lecturer at the Victoria University of Wellington School of Architecture, gave a cutting and hilarious assessment of student culture to open the first formal day of Ctrl Shift 07, the Biennial Pacific Student Congress of Architecture. A few of the Freerangers who put the Congress on recently revisited his lecture, and had to share his Ten Rules on Being an Architecture Student, transcribed here to capture Peter’s deliciously acerbic critique.\n\n2. Always work at least one all-nighter for every studio. Two is better as it suggests that you’re not doing the first one to follow the rules. Never do more then three in a row as this suggests genuine psychological problems, or it will lead to genuine psychological problems.\n\n3. Meet the right people. This is a tough one because architecture students, architectural academics, academics, and in fact anyone from your immediate cultural grouping, is not the right people. The right people should meet three criteria: they should have money, they should want to give you their money, and they should not be interested in telling you how you should spend their money. Your parents are a good place to start.\n\n4. Show dismissive scorn toward successful architects. After all, they are just cynical old fuddy-duddies who sold their creative integrity to developers because their bums like leather car seats, and anyway, you’ll never be like them.\n\n5. Attend all openings. Art exhibitions, public lectures, new buildings, roof shouts, car doors, the only thing that matters is how disdainful you look, and the amount of free food and drinks.\n\n6. Be I.T. savvy. It’s a digital world, and the more digital you look, the easier it will be to pass architecture off as a modern activity. Fortunately this has never been easier, it doesn’t matter what you listen to, whether its Burt Bacherach or anything else on your MP3 player, or that your laptop contains pictures of dairy cows, or that you only pretend to text-message due to the inability of bovine hooves to operate cellphones. The only real point is how shiny, expensive and visible your gadgets are.\n\n7. Become moderately proficient at espousing the views of a continental philosopher. Avoid the big names as its most likely that someone will know more about them than you. Choose instead a minor player from some Marxist circle and pick out the bits of their writing that might possibly have something to do with architecture. Liberally sprinkle these through your comments at openings.\n\n8. Learn the lingo. Every attempt must be made to speak in architectural jargon. People might live in houses, but architects design responsive environments that challenge domestic paradoxes which combine atavistic references with new post-post-modern epistemologies.\n\n9. Avoid student counseling. Conventional wisdom has it that student counseling is the quickest way to arrange a medical certificate for an assignment deadline extension. But once they have you on the couch describing your childhood, who knows what might happen. Instead, go to Student Health, tell them it hurts to tinkle, and save the antibiotic prescription for the bronchial condition your all-nighters will give you.\n\n10. Organise an international congress. If only because it makes achieving the other criteria much easier.\n\nPeter Wood, on Ctrl Shift 07: Biennial Pacific Student Congress of Architecture. [DVD] is available in most architecture Libraries across Australia & New Zealand.\n\n“Not in the habit of saving things for posterity or thinking themselves as history. Not caring about the past, not seeing too much future to look forward too. Whether or not that was really true, it was definitely the understood attitude and mood… I’ve just started on this book and already I’m on a tangent…”\n\nAaron Cometbus\n\nTime. It’s treated quite strangely in the world of punk rock. Most people arrive as though they were the first. And they leave out the back door to make way for a younger, more energised generation. Aaron Cometbus, of the Bay Area fanzine Cometbus, nailed it in a retrospective on his first 20 years of zine-making. When it came to cultural self-awareness, he claimed that punks were decidedly evasive. Whether fueled by idealism or nihilism, they were preoccupied in a haze of the ‘spirit of the times’. The view from the blazing vehicle of punk rock is framed by a combination of radical ideas, growing pains and fast guitars. Vision under such speed is surely fuzzy. Beyond the ‘here and now’ getting a cultural perspective to the past (or future) is hard. But the last decade or so has seen a renewed interest from within and without Wellington’s punk community with a call to explore the vestiges of time and uncover the recesses of the city’s nearly forgotten punk past.\n\nEnter Wellington’s own unique and peculiar cultural time-machine – UP THE PUNKS! It travels to depths of 35 years ago and up to the active present, exhibiting the stories and artefacts of a vibrant, living underground community. The ongoing documenting and open source archiving initiative provides an important means of linking together a body of diverse works such as music, arts, literature, activism and various aspects of DIY culture, which would otherwise seem disparate across generations past and present. Youth culture is rarely this prolific and broadly expressed. It is a showcase of spirit – the good, the bad and the downright ugly.\n\nOriginal poster for UP THE PUNKS 2002 designed by Kerry Ann Lee\n\nTo claw back the history of an obscure society, obsessed with its very obscurity, is not an easy task. Works can be as fleeting as youth itself, leaving little trace, if any at all. But memory will still prevail. People still fondly recall the legendary performance of influential bands which never lasted long enough to produce more than a rough demo and play at some house parties; rants from a younger version of someone-you-know found in a photocopied zine which was subsequently lost to time and a small print run; piles of old screen-printed posters and merch; dusty records and cordially exchanged mixtapes now warped and stretched; abandoned film negatives of rallies and hangouts with cherished friends. Interesting and unexpected things happens when returning to these places.\n\nPunk was always positioned in relation to a wider context, differentiating itself from mainstream society. But over time, as we all know, things change, the mainstream changes too, and so each generational iteration of punk rockers bear traces of that change too. I can’t help but recall the backdrop of a transitional Wellington city in the 1990s, its people waking up from the quiet slumber of economic downturn. People were crawling out of brutalist buildings determined to paint over the grey walls that had only served to compliment the depressive color of the sky.\nWhether or not these are actually my own memories, I’m reminded of something geographic, something spatial and material, tangible and almost graspable; squats on the waterfront as Te Papa was still in construction; un-refurbished flats with remnants of 70’s décor; walking home after school via The Freedom Shop, the local anarchist bookstore which was housed in a rustic shed on upper Cuba St before being squeezed out by the Bypass; the hired-out community halls; picking bottles off the street during shows; skinhead encounters in Newlands; skateboarding with mates in the Hutt; the patience required to order records and zines from overseas…\n\nThe Cure jamming at a house party in Mount Victoria, August 4, 198.1\n\nUP THE PUNKS presents a case for continuity between generations otherwise fragmented and disjointed. In doing so it proves, in my mind at least, that the past 35 years wasn’t just an excuse for playing silly buggers after all (although there was a great deal of that too). It’s evidence of a sustained cultural activity. In such a hotbed for ideals put into action, ideas can last a long time, or burn out alongside musical trends, fashion, and haircuts. I’m curious as to how punk – peripheral by nature – has extended and adapted to other aspects of society, or whether (in many cases I imagine) it is left to the embarrassments of youth. It would be interesting to know what happened to those kids as they enter different areas of society, as they develop skill-sets for new contexts and responsibilities. It is contributions from these people that keeps the UP THE PUNKS online archive lively. I can think proudly of punk friends who are now educators, union organisers, lawyers, academics, artists, health care professionals, engineers, innovators, activists, musicians, amazing parents, and just all round good people.\n\nWithout continuing to sound like a back-in-the-day-old-timer, it has to be said that a big aspect of the UP THE PUNKS effort is to present Wellington punk culture as a living community, uniquely localised and continuing today in full force. It stands in contrast to the picture painted by a Te Papa exhibition ten years ago that presented punk as a petrified historical nomenclature that only happened elsewhere. The ongoing spirit of participation from enthusiastic new blood will ensure that punk respond to a changing world, ultimately securing the promise of it’s future.\n\nAnd because of the open sourced, participatory nature of the UP THE PUNKS archive, we now have a means of looking back through the noise of time. With the raw information available to all, the historical narrative of punk in Wellington can be constantly rewritten and contested.\n\nAt 16 years and counting, Punkfest is New Zealand’s longest running annual punk event.\n\nUP THE PUNKS proposes one last important thing; that this living history is also a slice of the city’s history. It’s “the Wellington you didn’t know you didn’t know” as aptly put by John Lake in the Pledgeme fundraising campaign. The minor stories told here reveal the material culture of life in Wellington as told by the people themselves. It is also relevant for the story of independent music in New Zealand. These stories are our history and it’s a history to be shared by all.\n\nExhibition Opening Night: November 6, 2012, 6PM, Thistle Hall Gettin’ Worse: Punx Still Angry, November 7, San Fran Bathhouse.

The many signs on the streets of Christchurch: – Haircuts – Architectural Design – Fashion Design – Passport Photos A complete range of signs, some hand painted; really connecting the sign to that person, that business. I’m thinking small business not big business, thinking local business in my neighbourhood and not 30 minutes away in the city centre. I’m also thinking I’ll support thy neighbour and perhaps they will support me – Community!\n\nINTERVIEW\n\nI interviewed a range of businesses earlier in the year; Stuart Manning Architects, the PhotoMan, and Briar Cook from Rethreads Clothing Label. I presented the information at the recent SHAC Conference in May 2012 – www.shac.org.nz . Asking the audience whether we should have a network of skills in our neighbourhood? The overwhelming answer was yes.\n\nI ask Briar Cook from Rethreads, What is it like working from home? Briar Responds, “People are beginning to know I’m here.

I went inside.\n\nA displaced Gallery now selling artwork from their home, open to the public. Let’s support art from innovative spaces, let’s support emerging artists. Another link: facebook.com/artexplore I was wowed by the fact ‘High St Galleries’ were in my backyard – a gallery two doors down. And the trust this family had to let strangers through their house to view art. Viewing art amongst the kitchen and lounge – in its true state of place perhaps. This innovative space, people drinking wine and eating cheese like a fine art gallery, though in a home -these elements trans-placed to the home.\n\nSongs for Christchurch\n\nWe’ve been working closely with artists around the world, including 2 grammy award winning artists, for around 18 months on this project. Launching later this year, we’ve just started a fundraising project to raise some funds to support the release. Pledgeme site.\n\nThe Children of Parihaka\n\nIn 2009, a group of Taranaki children were taken on a bus trip to visit the places their ancestors, passive resistors from Parihaka in the 1880s, were imprisoned and forced to labour in. Places like Addington Jail in Christchurch and various buildings and roads they worked on in Dunedin. Along the way, they were welcomed at local marae by descendants of local Maori who supported the prisoners at the time. It was an emotional journey, documented by Joseph’s camera and the children themselves. The narration is by the children, from their writing, poetry, song and art, expressed in a workshop after the journey.\n\nLurujarri Dreaming\n\nThis collaborative documentary will be a vehicle for the Goolarabooloo people to share their culture, history and vision for reconciliation with a wide national and international audience via broadcast, film festivals and online platforms. The Goolarabooloo are currently threatened by the prospect of a massive LNG refinery on their land, which threatens their sacred Songline, the Lurujarri Heritage Trail and there ability to carry out traditional cultural practices. The soundtrack will be composed by the renowned Deadly Award winning Broome indigenous musicians- the Pigram Brothers.\n\nIn the small mud-floored kitchen, around the kitchen fire bordered by 3 large stones (to put the pots on), the middle son is home with his 8 year-old for a visit. The three adults discuss life, the city, work – or lack-thereof. The 2 grandsons that live on the homestead are seated there as well, with their cousin, quietly listening to the adult conversation. One of the boys sings, but it is barely heard; the others dig their feet into the ground and fidget. But I can only imagine this based on the conversation in a language that I don’t understand that comes billowing out of the barely open door and the small square window. The conversation is accompanied by the suffocating smoke from the kitchen fire, fighting for a place to escape from the confines of the small space.\n\nI steal understandings of bits of words and, of course, proper names like the capital city where the son now lives, with his wife and son in the second largest urban slum on the continent, barely making ends-meet. I stand just a few meters from the wood building, looking up through the rainclouds of the Long Rains season through the pitch-black to a few constellations, barely visible. I look back at the square-shaped room with an orange burning light shining through not only the cracked door and window, but also the open slats that let the rain in this morning while we watched the water heating for our baths.\n\nThe conversation is familiar, one that I have had with my own parents in their kitchen during one of my countless visits home. There is a relay back and forth of question-answer, then intermittently the son explains further or the mother continues on a monologue asking and comparing, hoping to glean a bit more about her son’s life that is not so unfamiliar to her, she is from a city near by, not the capital, but she is no stranger to the hustle and bustle, but perhaps she has forgotten all of that. Perhaps the forty-some years that she has spent in the high rolling hills tending to their farm and dairy cows, perhaps this less-busy life has allowed her to forget the hand-to-mouth that she, presumably, once lived.\n\nThe oldest of the grandsons pops out and I quickly change my gaze back to the sky again, attempting to make myself invisible. Though the night is so dark with no moonlight and no artificial light for miles, at least to the closest town, being invisible isn’t so difficult. Then I remember the conversation I had with the shopkeeper today when we made the hike to town for supplies that cannot be reaped from their land, power had been out in the town for the last 2 days – no mobile charging, no television, only the police station, with their noisy generator, could be seen with their lights on at night. The grandson dumps some water and with a clang grabs something from under the chicken coop and glides back into the warm kitchen shutting the door just a few centimeters more behind him.\n\nNicole Rademacher was in Kenya from February until May of 2012 doing research and documentation for her current project investigating domestic ritual (made possible by the North Carolina Arts Council, USA and many private donars/patrons).\n\nLast month I was cycle touring through Japan with a friend from Melbourne, John.\n\nThroughout the trip he often spoke of Hobo-camping, that is just ‘sleeping rough’ in a park on on bench somewhere, no tent, no sleeping mat, sleeping public style. He had read about Japan being the ideal place for it on some ‘urban camping’ blogs.\n\nSo one night on the shores of Lake Biwa a little north of Kyoto with no camping grounds around and the possibility of rain during the night he suggested we should Hobo camp, I wasn’t that keen at first but with lack of any nice spots to free camp I went along with it.\n\nWe rode along the shore of the lake looking for a likely shelter, we found one, a pagoda with two benches under cover, surrounded by a low wall and long eaves in case the rain came. It was right beside a small road and a restaurant, which luckily closed at 9pm, there was also a ubiquitous drink vending machine nearby which threatened to cast effervescent light across us all night whilst we tried to sleep. I suggested we try unplug it and indeed the plug was exposed and there for the pulling but then I half-jokingly mentioned that in Japanese style this would probably alert someone somewhere that the Calpis and Pocari Sweat (two of the more amusingly named Japanese soft drinks) were warming and they would come to plug the machine back in. We resolved to just hunker down behind the sides of the pagoda and try block the light of the drinks machine out. So we lay back, both succumbing to the hard boards we rolled our sleeping mats out, leaned our bikes against the benches and watched the tiny bats emerge form the rafters and fly out in search of insects on the wing.\n\nI slept surprisingly well until around 2am when I awoke to a car idling right beside the pagoda. I lay there thinking the car would move on soon, it didn’t, I began wondering what it was doing there, they could clearly see our bikes and probably realise we were trying to sleep. For an hour or so it just sat idling and I fell back to sleep, then I woke to see the guy from the car putting a plastic container on the bench where John had been sleeping (he had since moved down onto the grass outside), he placed a cellphone atop the water and then hung a inflated swimming ring right above John’s head. I caught Johns eye, and he looked as confused as I was. But it was 3am and the guy since had returned to his car, and driven off, so we went back to sleep. I woke a couple more times as the car returned to idle outside the pagoda.\n\nWhen the sun cam up at 5am, John and I got up and sat bleary eyed looking at the water container, cellphone and swimming ring, and then turning to look at the car still idling next to the pagoda, I didn’t know what was going on. We slowly packed our stuff up and rolled down the lake shore 100m to a picnic table to make coffee and eat breakfast, as soon as we did the rest of the cars inhabitants emerged, a women and 3 children who supposedly had been sleeping inside the idling car the whole time, the kids ran down to the lake to swim (it was midsummer it was already swim worthy at 5.30am).\n\nWe realised that the family had come to the lake for the day and wanted to ‘bags’ that pagoda for the day, and decided they needed to get in early, real early obviously (even though that stretch of the lake was deserted) and that the something valuable like a cellphone is needed to make the claim (or maybe they are going to ring it if to wake us lazy gaijin up if we slept in).\n\nIt was a strange experience, both showing how safe Japan is (I don’t think I’d feel safe sleeping on a bench by the side of the road in New Zealand or Australia) but also how focused some Japanese can be, that guy knew he was going to get that pagoda for his family and two Gaijin cyclists weren’t gonna stop him.\n\nI am scribbling about bicycles, because I like them, and about piracy, as Freerange claims to be very interested in pirates, but has very little visible piratical content.\n\nBut let me preface this with a disclaimer:\n\nI despise people who steal bicycles. I think that there is a special circle of hell reserved for bicycle thieves and the abusers of animals and children. In saying this I am walking a fine line, because like most forms of piracy, bicycle piracy is not as black and white as I’d like it to be.\n\n*\n\nI love bicycles, and I dislike waste. These fit together nicely, as bicycles are some of the least wasteful objects humans have ever managed to produce.\n\nAnd bicycles make you greater than yourself. Slip onto a well-made bicycle, clip your shoes into the pedals and let your hands rest lightly on the bars and it feels like strapping on a pair of wings. You become something new.\n\nAstride a well made bike you become strong. You can swoop across jammed cities, silent as an owl. A good bicycle is a perfect piece of hand-tooled minimalism with the merest hint of wheels, but which allows you to slice through the frigid morning, and nothing, not snow, nor gridlock nor petrol prices can stop you. Although snow can just make you want to stay in, drink wine, and bake instead.\n\nWhenever I’m without a bicycle I feel like some crippled city pigeon that’s reduced to hobbling about instead of soaring. Every bicycle is a gift of wings. Which means that every abandoned and abused bicycle is a wasted gift.\n\n*\n\nMost cities have these wasted bicycles, chained and rusting against lamp-posts, fire escapes and bike-racks, and not just left there for a day or two while the owner’s away, but abandoned the way that many horrible people abandon kittens when they grow into cats. Maybe the owner left town or forgot the combination to their lock. Maybe a tire went flat or a wheel got bent and the owner couldn’t be bothered fixing it, the result is the same. The bike sits in the weather for a few seasons, often being stripped of it’s more easily removed parts by whatever scavenging creatures come along and strip abandoned bicycles in the middle of the night, and then it just becomes a corpse, a rusting thing, like a skeleton still chained to a wall.\n\nIt’s a myth that bicycles can live outside. They can get wet, but they shouldn’t stay wet. After a bicycle has been left in the rain for a winter all it’s delicate component parts will be just a rusted solid mass, no matter how expensive and well-maintained they were to begin with.\n\nBut if you get in quick, before the rust and the (other) scavengers, this fate can be avoided.\n\n*\n\nIn 2010 I lived in San Sebastian for a time. It’s a beautiful city in Spain near the French border. It’s perfect for cycling, impossible to drive in, and has a huge seasonal population who come to work the summer and then leave as the jobs dry up and the rains come back and the city closes for winter.\n\nThis seasonal population get about by bicycle as the city has a web of idyllic bike lanes, and then they often abandon their bikes when they leave town for winter.\n\nI was living in San Sebastian with an equally bike-obsessed friend, Peter, and I was about to be joined by another friend, Jenna, who was going to ride west with me from San Sebastian. Jenna didn’t travel with a bike forever in her luggage like Peter and I did, and Spanish Ebay wasn’t being helpful at providing a bike for her either, but we kept seeing beautiful mixte frames locked and rusting on the streets, begging to be ridden.\n\n*\n\nIt’s easy to tell an abandoned bicycle. First, both tires must be completely flat. One tire may have gone flat anyway, leading to it’s abandonment, but the other will take at least six weeks to deflate completely. If both tires are totally flat it generally means the bike hasn’t been ridden for at least a month. Secondly, the chain should be rusted and seized, so that even if you pumped the tires up the bike would still be unrideable without some serious mechanical attention. Thirdly, the bike should have at least one missing or broken component. Maybe the front wheel is twisted into a pretzel, or the seat and seatpost are missing. If a bicycle ticks all three of these boxes, you can bet no-one’s sitting up at night worrying about it.\n\nStrangely, it’s not just the Walmart-grade clunkers that get abandoned. There are plenty of unloved thoroughbreds rusting their last days away along the streets we all live on. I presume this happens because as bicycles become third and fourth hand they pass often into the ownership of people who have no idea of what they’re owning. Plus there is a strange period before a thing becomes ‘classic” when it’s just seen as “old”.\n\n*\n\nIn San Sebastian the city council even identified abandoned bicycles for us by orange-stickering them. The orange stickers are dated, and state that if the bikes aren’t removed in two months the council will cut them loose and dump them. Sometimes these bikes cluster three or four deep round lamp-posts, forming rusty coral reefs that are large enough to block pedestrian traffic, hence the council’s insistence on removing them.\n\nSo by removing them ourselves we would be performing a public service.\n\nNo one bicycle that was definitely abandoned was in good enough condition to become a reliable touring bike for Jenna. So we began looking for bikes that had useful parts. And in our looking we started to see some gems amongst the chaff. Here a 1970’s Frejus with no front wheel or saddle. There an original ALAN in bright blue, it’s delicious Italian components so rusted that examining them made my tummy hurt.\n\nWhat is a good citizen to do?\n\nLiberate them as well, of course.\n\nNot steal them. Liberate them\n\n*\n\nPeter and I arose at three am with a hacksaw and our maps and went bike-picking. By six am the hallway of our apartment had five new bicycles. Three of them we mangled into a touring bike for Jenna. Peter and I fooled about with the other two until they were functional again and then rode them round San Sebastian on sunny days. Jenna’s bike lasted two thousand kilometers, starting the trip as a ten speed and ending as a four speed. which she later sold for twenty five euros before jumping on a train to Sweden.\n\nI kept the ALAN. I managed to pack it in with my other bicycle on my way to London, and sold it there to a man in Brick Lane Cycles for enough so that it nearly paid for my flight back to New Zealand.\n\n*\n\nI’m uncertain what i’m trying to say here. I would never advocate stealing a bicycle. Having a loved bicycle stolen is crippling and horrible. I’m tiny, and a confirmed pacifist, but I once chased a huge man away from a girlfriend’s stolen bicycle using only a carbon-fibre tennis raquet, which in a fight is about as useful as a toilet roll. That’s the sort of outrage that bicycle theft provokes in me.\n\nBut letting a beautiful piece of craftsmanship decay and rust out of sheer negligence provokes outrage in me as well. It’s a crime of omission, like that of wasting food, or of not separating your recycling,\n\nSo I think perhaps a little bit of educated bicycle piracy, of taking the law into your own hands in an informed way doesn’t hurt either. I suppose I’ve rescued maybe a half-dozen bikes off the streets now. I tend to give them away afterwards, which is nicely moral and robin-hoodish, but I guess what I’m saying is “Take care of your bicycles. Or they may be taken care of for you”\n\n.\n\n5 Things You Need To Know About Bats Right Now\n\na) Unlike as often portrayed in popular medias, bats can’t really fly, but instead propel themselves from crude catapult devices, located on secret space bases near the moon.\n\nb) It’s no coincidence “bat” backwards is “stab”.

The library makes you pay for all the real books you destroy with water — and I mean all of them!\n\nDear Rest of New Zealand, our caring family, friends, school mates, colleagues, and lost loves. Those of you who experience Christchurch through the newspapers and the TVs.\n\nIt is now two years since the strangeness descended on Christchurch. The first shake that set of the rolling maul of mixed emotions that continues now: senses of luck, despair, abandonment, love, hope, hopelessness, excitement, of people lost and communities gained.\n\nRemember in hours and days after the February earthquake, staring at the television, with tears streaming down your eyes feeling powerless in the face of such violence and randomness.\n\nRemember in the days and weeks after February trying to keep in touch with friends, loved ones, and old acquaintances. Not really knowing how to help, but offering none the less.\n\nRemember in the weeks and months, when your focus returned to your own lives, to your own financial crisis, and your own family tragedies. The events became something remembered in anniversaries and progressed measured through small items on the news.\n\nThe rubble maybe slowly disappearing into deep holes, but believe us when we say the city is still on fire. There are thousands of individual battles occurring across the city, it’s a massive slow moving urban bush fire that’s been raging now for 2 years. It’s hard to see the form of the future when you are fighting for your own house, securing your own city.\n\nWhule your tears may have dried, people here are still crying, and these tears aren’t enough to put out the fires raging in our lives. People are tired, tired from two years of stress and fighting fires. Grey is the new colour of Christchurch, and it isn’t the sky and empty building sites. Those photos you see of elderly people getting angry at insurance companies haven’t even had their mid-life crisis yet.\n\nThe urban surgeons and political gamblers can see a new city. It’s not even an act of imagination for them, it’s so real it’s almost tangible. They have such confidence in the strength of it’s vision, it’s power, its uniqueness. IT’S INNOVATIVE. It’s best practice. It’ll be cutting edge. It’s going to be an ICONIC CITY MOVING FORWARD. It’s so new and exciting it can’t really be explained in language we understand. We say “great, but who is paying for it?” They say “Oh, you are of course, but we can’t tell you how much it will cost.”\n\nIt’s the paternal nature of the political approach that is so unsettling, experts telling us how we want to live in our own city. We have become so marginalized in our own city that the idea that we might have something constructive to add is considered radical. Everything is backwards, upside down. We fear that by the time we work it all out we will be living in someone else’s city.\n\nIt’s like ignoring the quiet terror of domestic violence. The victim is too tired to complain, too exhausted to think that there might be another type of relationship. The violence is not so much to the body as to the imagination. The abuser is drunk on power, forcing her to sell of her grandmother’s jewellery to pay for his grandiose visions. “But you said you like nice things” he whispers at night.\n\nOr perhaps its the patient and the expert doctor about to undertake another round of emergency operations, they’ve almost lost her so many times, and now her family has to keep working so aren’t there to support her. She was sick before the accident, so the doctors have decided to try some new techniques. Trust us the doctor says we are the experts, we are doing everything to get you back to health. She feels tired, exhausted. The endless pain killers and aesthetic are effecting her memory, she sometimes forgets what life was like before the accident. Sometimes she gets confused and angry, “What are you doing to my body?” The doctors don’t like seeing their patients get up set, so they’ve largely stopped explaining the complex operations they are doing to her, instead politely returning questions with questions “You want to walk again don’t you?”\n\nWhat’s this all about you say? Stop talking in metaphors! It’s hard because we are still in the fog of war, buildings demolished, news announcements made, plans launched. It’s all a confusing blur. But there are a few simple and startling truths to start with.\n\nWe don’t actually know who is governing us. Think about what that means. The Canterbury Earthquake Reconstruction act means we don’t know who has authority over the big decisions in our lives. The Christchurch City Council seems bewildered by situation, CERA tries to be friendly but is secretive to its core.\n\nThe government is in the process of the biggest government buy out of private land in our small nations history. They claim it is voluntary but it is founded on the thuggish threat that if you don’t sell the government will cut off your power and water, and you won’t be able to insure your house.\n\nThe recent government blue print was created with no input from citizens of the city. Doctors aren’t allowed to do this our bodies, teachers aren’t allowed to do this to our children, so why is this process (which despite their claims goes against contemporary international best practice) allowed in our city?\n\nThe government, with our tacit permission, is failing those that we owe most to, our elderly. It is humiliating and shameful that our elders, our kuia and kaumatua are been left alone to deal with the violent bureaucracy of EQC, insurance companies, and CERA. If society is measured by how it treats its young and elderly, then we are failing. It is well known the elderly are strong and resolute in crisis, they understand what it means to put others ahead of themselves, to sacrifice. But it is also well known that this sacrifice is often too much for an aged body to bear, and it is often the case that many die quickly after the initial strength and resilience. Plans for the future are nice to things to have, but we shouldn’t forget the reality around us, even if it is hidden behind closed doors.\n\nBut this isn’t just about us. If other ways aren’t articulated, aren’t argued for clear and loud, then this process becomes normal, inevitable. Then politics has won over people, and your city will be next. Even now the extraordinary legislation being used in Christchurch that enables cabinet to make executive decisions without the normal checks and balances such as the Resource Management Act has been used as a precedent in the War Memorial Project in Wellington. Watchout New Zealand, the NZ cabinet urban design team is coming to a city near you!\n\nThe stresses of our lives, the focus on holding our own ground in difficult times is making us forget our collective powers. We only have what we have because at various points in the past others have stood up for our rights, our rights as citizens, as parents, as children, as Maori, as women, as disabled, and even just our right to be human.\n\nRight now there are many groups in New Zealand really fundamentally struggling to live a just life: the young and poor, the forgotten elderly, and many many burnout and tired people in Christchurch.\n\nCome for a visit, have a walk around and think about what your home town would look like if this happened to you, and think about how others would be able to help you.

Emphasis was placed on articles, reports and published reviews published between 1990-2001. Japanese encephalitis has recently emerged in Australia, with reported outbreaks in the Torres Strait and north Queensland. Murine typhus needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever, headache and rash, especially if there has been possible exposure to rats and/or their droppings. If the symptoms follow exposure to ticks, or following a known tick bite, then Australian spotted fever needs to be considered. Australian bat lyssavirus can cause a fatal rabies-like disease in humans exposed to infection by bites or scratches from bats. Leptospirosis should be suspected in any patient with an appropriate history of exposure (especially occupational) and a history of myalgia, arthralgia, fever, malaise and/or chest X-ray shadowing. Capnocytophaga should be specifically sought in any patient with fever and/or septicaemia following a dog bite, especially if immunocompromised. Along with melioidosis, Chromobacteriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a rapidly progressing septic illness with skin lesions and/or multiple visceral abscesses in a patient exposed to soil or muddy water. Edwardsiella ought to be considered as the causative agent of a soft tissue infection, septic arthritis or septicaemia in a recreational fisher or swimmer, especially if following a marine puncture wound. If the exposure is related to salty or brackish water, then Vibriosis needs to be considered. Vibriosis should also be suspected in a patient with septicaemia and a history of recent ingestion of raw or under-cooked seafood, especially oysters. Critical care physicians need to remain alert to unusual infectious agents as many can lead to significant morbidity and are associated with a high mortality rate.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

The firms' arrangements with Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will be investigated. Announcing the move, tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta said that 'fair tax competition is essential.' Last year, a US Senate investigation accused Ireland of giving special tax treatment to Apple. The European Commission will look at whether the companies' tax affairs breach EU rules on state aid. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: 'In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.' Countries in Europe cannot allow certain firms to pay less tax than they should, Mr Almunia added.\"\n\nBecause its much much much larger than the other two companies mentioned, and the fact that Apple is directly named is of more interest to us tech geeks here on Slashdot than either Starbucks or Fiat...\n\nBecause this is a tech website and the other ones listed aren't tech companies? Because Apple in many ways are rapidly approaching monopoly positions in manufacturing and some tech development?Because why not, people will complain anyway?\n\nEveryone has been doing it because they know the apple name gets attention. Same with the chinese labour. All tech companies have their hands dirty but apple got singled out. Apple has improved while others haven't I'm sure all of china's work force is happy that a minuscule number of them have an improved work life.\n\nThe European Commission raised pressure on Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg over their corporatetax practices, saying it was investigating deals the countries have cut with Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.\n\nThe EU is looking at whether the countries' tax treatment of multinationals, which help to attract investment and jobs that might otherwise go to where the companies' customers are based, represent unfair state aid.\n\nI see that you don't fully understand what the EU is.\nThe EU IS their member states. The European Commision is put in place by the govenrments of the states of the EU and the EU council is no more and no less than the very PMs and presidents of these very same EU countries. The laws and rules proposed y the EU commision are actualy drafted and proposed by the EU States' parliaments. The only directly elected organ of the EU is the EU parliament, the rest is nothing more and nothing less than an extension o\n\nYou're assuming that what's happening in Ireland is a tax loophole and is not, instead, the system working exactly as they intend it to. If there were loopholes, they would have fixed them by now. No, this is the system working exactly as intended.\n\nOr, when you declare various expenses when filing your taxes to reduce your tax burden, do you consider those deductions to be tax loopholes as well?\n\nSystem working as intended. This investigation will result in nothing other than a handful of politicians getting t\n\nBack in the eighties Ireland was quite poor and had high unemployment and was trying to develop US foreign direct investment with the help of the US. The loophole that Apple is taking advantage of is that according to US tax law you pay tax where the company is headquartered and with Irish tax law you pay tax where the company is managed from. So Apple ends up paying tax to neither country. I wouldn't be surprised if that Irish tax law was introduced back then in the eighties and the Irish and the Americans\n\nno, the job of the competition commissioner is to stifle competition amongst EU member states so the EU as a whole benefits. His job is to encourage competition amongst companies operating here.\n\nBig difference between a company and a country, especially when those countries are supposed to be part of a single federal superstate (whoops, might have given away a secret known only to the EU commission there!)\n\nIt has nothing to do with creating a \"superstate\", it's merely to level the playing field for free trade. That's a point many people seem to miss - even if one country left the EU with the intention of setting up trade deals to get the benefits of trading without the \"superstate\" it would still have to accept all this stuff. The only difference would be that it no longer has any say in it.\n\nOne of the current political issues over Mr Junker is that he is one of these federalists.\n\nNo, one of the current political issues is that Cameron is crapping his pants over the UKIP. So much that he attacks the more democratic election of the president of the European Council now after the election instead of back when Juncker was nominated as candidate by the European People's Party - which either means he doesn't understand how democracy works, or was betting everything on the Party of European Socialists winning.\n\nOf course UKIP got the majority vote in the UK EU elections, and so did the Front Nationale in the French. I think the Golden Dawn got a large vote in the Greek.\n\nSo if democracy is listening to the people, then it makes sense to get a different, reformist candidate. Though, I guess the established groupings that currently favour the EPP will get Juncker in, next time round things probably be very different, with an outright majority of nationalistic parties.... which isn't something we really want.\n\nThey're very diligent about keeping tax costs low and manufacturing costs very low. They use marketing and image to keep prices high. They pump as much money out of the middle class and as little as possible into the (world) lower class.\n\nNominally, that's supposed to be how businesses work, but in that same nominal world, competition is supposed to bring prices down. Apple is the clearest example of how marketing and branding are tools to keep that from happening.\n\nbut in that same nominal world, competition is supposed to bring prices down.\n\nYes, but it also brings purchasing power down, so there's an abundance of crap that only a minority can afford, and workers have to struggle ever harder to survive. Although his rants about revolution are without evidential basis, Marx's predictions about capitalism have mostly turned out correct.\n\nAnyone who finds their life getting easier - hell, anyone like me with the luxury of being able to post on/. on a weekday morning/afternoon - is part of a tiny minority. We could pretend that hard work got us\n\nBut it also brings effective purchasing power up by bringing costs down, which in a healthy and competitive market results in prices falling still farther. No, what reduces purchasing power is the decreasing share of profits being given to the worker. Worker productivity has increased, but worker compensation in real money (adjusted for inflation) or as a share of profit has decreased for many decades running.\n\nAnyone who finds their life getting easier - hell, anyone like me with the luxury of being able to post on/. on a weekday morning/afternoon - is part of a tiny minority.\n\nHere's what brings down purchasing power: six billion more people who can do your job. Supply and demand applied to labor completely explains what has happened to the developed world over the past fifty or so years. You don't need a 19th century kook to think this through.\n\nIt's a straightforward manipulation of demand to increase demand for your particular labor.\n\nMy point is \"supply and demand\" is insufficient explanation to what happened to the developed world.\n\nAnd you have yet to make your point.\n\nI used the word \"rose\" to mean an increase from previous levels.\n\nAnd you would be in error to make that claim. It is rather the relative lack of interference (even including the effects of protectionism and the modern social state) from modern governments that is unusual compared to the historical record.\n\nI pointed out that kook is the one who popularized the idea of manipulating markets.\n\nAnd I noted markets were manipulated long before Marx. For example, a common bronze-age economic system was the \"palace economy\" [wikipedia.org]. These societies had most of their trade and wealth redistribution channel through a central administration (the \"palace\"). The pharaohs of Egypt are one such example.\n\nFurther, we have kooks today advocating similar degrees of market manipulation. What makes Marx so special that we should even be mentioning him?\n\nThe Civil War and the following Reconstruction was huge interference compared to before.\n\nIf the majority of patents are anything but stupid, why is prior art such a big deal? Why is \"first to publish\" such a race? If a creation is truly novel, then prior art or simultaneous publication should be an amazingly improbable newsworthy coincidence.\n\nPatents are based on the idea that what you invent is non-obvious. I guess no one ever told most of the anti-free-competition crowd, but no matter how smart you are, there is always someone smarter. Nothing you create is non-obvious to everyone else. Y\n\nIdeally, competition based on quality to price ratio in each market niche is how business should work. But every business man on the planet would happily embrace monopoly if it is his own monopoly. Capitalism is not about competition, it is about control. Against that, John Q Citizen has to depend on civil regulations to keep product standards high, and financial practices honest, for example, minimum wage standards, lemon laws, safety and health standards.\nBut, what would happen if the USA had a minimum w\n\nDoes software write itself? Services? Store-fronts and their employees? How about hedging against future competition or cannibalisation? Against mistakes like MobileMe or exploding batteries? Against patent-wars with similarly well-endowed companies? Will the time come when they don't sell any more kit because everyone is too satisfied to bother upgrading anymore? Was the last WWDC Keynote an absolute firecracker because of the excitement over the new APIs, or a squib because they didn't announce an iWatch or a TV?\n\nNo. Software is written, in the case of Apple, by programmers in the U.S. Then the resulting code magically becomes 'owned' by an Irish subsidiary that exists just to own this code and prevent that component of Apple's products from being taxed. I don't even think any money is transferred from the Irish subsidiary to US Apple which might count as income in the US. It's all a fiction to avoid taxation - which in turn requires the rest of us to pick up the slack.\n\nAs always when it concerns the economy/. is mostly full of complete nonsense. Apple is a wealth GENERATION engine, no iPhones, no iPads etc. are taken from anybody by Apple and 'extracted', they are created by Apple and then redistributed into the population. As per usual the socialists completely miss the entire point of the economy and of free market capitalism, which is the engine that produces wealth at the rate higher than any other methodology ever discovered by humans on this planet.\n\nsome countries like the USA tax all the worldwide income of a company like apple and googleits impossible for any company to be in compliance with the law in every nation they operate in if they have to pay 30% taxes on all of their worldwide income to each of a half dozen countries\n\nthe last thing we need is 1 global system. the UN would be the worst group to even consider. we dont need a N.W.O., we need choice, and if everyone on the planet is under the same rules of law, we as a species are doomed to slavery to those who run the N.W.O.\n\n'NWO' simply meant the standing of the world powers (the leader board, if you will) after the fall of the USSR. It was then co-opted by some lunatic conspiracy nuts who thought it sounded scary, and now is known as \"the three letters by which you can know a paranoid lunatic\". The NWO is not an organisation, or a goal, or a manifesto, or a cause, or anything - it's just a ranking of the post-USSR powers. Every time you use it people laugh at you, because they can see you don't really know what you're talk\n\ndont disagree with you one bit as an american even. But it doesnt mean I want to see the EU become the other america when it comes to telling the world what to do . I think the EU had a good goal, but I think in the end the concept of the EU is bound to fail\n\nMaybe the US has to say to each company, you have to pay 30% tax as that's our standard for US-based companies, but if you've already paid that elsewhere, show us and we'll give you a refund equal to what you paid. So they end up paying 30% to someone.\n\nTrouble is, they just set up shell companies that are subsidiaries and say we made no money to pay tax on, because of all that IP we had to buy from shell-company-x, woe is us.\n\nHowever, if shell-company-x had to pay tax at 30% too, the US would give it a refun\n\nTrouble is, they just set up shell companies that are subsidiaries and say we made no money to pay tax on, because of all that IP we had to buy from shell-company-x, woe is us.\n\nThe solution is basically a gross receipts tax, which does have its drawbacks but is a lot harder to dodge. I'm an accountant and take it from me that it is a LOT harder to fudge the top line than the bottom line. If you just tax profits then it is fairly trivial to shuffle money around such that you show \"no profit\". It's called Hollywood accounting [wikipedia.org]. All these schemes that Apple and others are engaging in are variations on Hollywood accounting.\n\nThe problem is that to change the tax system fundamentally (which is very seriously required), you need the cooperation of those who profit most from the current system, because they've essentially bought our governments.\n\nWashington State has B&O tax, which is basically a gross receipts tax. Microsoft still managed to dodge it for 12 years.\n\nNot saying it's impossible to dodge a gross receipts tax. Merely pointing out that any accountant will tell you that doing so is more difficult than dodging taxes based on profits, particularly if it is a federal gross receipts tax. The hoops to jump through to dodge a gross receipts tax are a significantly bigger pain in the @$$. Microsoft did what you describe by recording software sales in Nevada through a shell company - and it's not entirely clear that what they did was actually legal in this case.\n\nThe EU is moving to implement something like this. Tax calculated on the amount of business conducted in each member state, with corporation tax divided appropriately. Doesn't matter where the company is incorporate, if it does business in EU states it pays the taxes of those EU states in proportion, even if it is incorporated on some tiny Caribbean island.\n\nIt is arbitrary where the company is based as long as tax is based at point of revenue. With regard to justification of costs, either they are taxed upon full revenue or they accurately substantiated costs whether local or foreign and exclude profit margins from those costs, failure to fully substantiate costs result in full taxes on revenue. All profit shifting to tax havens or tax discounting countries must stop, those countries that specifically set out to steal the social services of other countries sh\n\nCountries that adopt the business climates most favorable to large corporations often attract them to the detriment of other nation-states.\n\ninstead of yelling at ireland for their practice they should perhaps try to emulate them. I mean instead of raising the rates or trying to punish those who are sucessful, how about we learn from them and do the same??\n\nThey cannot just emulate them. Ireland derives their advantage from their having low taxes relative to other countries, not from having low taxes in absolute terms. What you suggest is a global race to the bottom, which may be the default \"solution\" in the absence of effective mechanisms for collective action. Each country has an incentive to attract more business by lowering tax rates, but, if all of them lower rates, most of them will probably end up with lower total revenues than if they could just strike an agreement not to engage in tax competition. This is what the European Union is trying to do.\n\nWhether it is good or bad depends on what you think the effects will be and on how important a weight you place on the welfare of large multinational companies (or rather, some combination of their employees, customers and shareholders, since the tax burden falls on people) versus the public purse and the welfare of their smaller competitors.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons why countries are up in arms against these companies. Until recently, Starbucks was not paying corporate tax in the UK. Now, perhaps they were truly unprofitable, although it's hard to believe that such an iconic company would spend more than 14 years constantly opening stores without ever turning a profit AND would also tell investors that its UK operations were profitable when they were not. And there must be something deeply wrong with the UK market since many large, generally profitable companies (Apple, Google, Facebook) often fail to turn a profit there.\n\nThe real reason of course is that they use outdated tax laws that were never meant to apply to the kind of international transactions that are possible today to artificially record profits where they will be taxed the least. This is perfectly legal but contrary to the spirit of the tax agreements that were originally meant to prevent rather than encourage tax avoidance. The arms' length principle worked well when a UK company used to buy tomatoes from its Spanish subsidiary to make soup (there are publicly-available market prices for tomatoes), but not so much today when it comes to valuing the right to use the Starbucks logo, name, products and processes. If you manage to pay artificially-inflated fees to a shell corporation in a tax-haven or another EU country that you have made a deal with, you can make it look as if you did not make any profit in a country regardless of its actual profitability.\n\nThis makes no sense at all: how much you pay in tax is not a function of real economic factors but of how transactions between units within the company were structured on paper. And it is greatly unfair to smaller competitors who will have to pay taxes. Why should a small coffee shop pay at least 20% on its profits while Starbucks gets to pay a much lower rate even if it sells the same amount of coffee for the same price and has the same cost structure apart from the gimmick of using its own intellectual property?\n\nSince some people feel let their moral affections and prejudice against rich individuals (sometimes deserved, sometimes not) cloud their judgement , I'm going to explain what's going to happen and why.\n\n(1) EU Government makes a big deal about \"cracking down\" on rich individuals because it makes the general public happy and the general public doesn't bother to double check anything anyway\n\n(2) Big ceremony with lots of speeches\n\n(3) Meeting between large companies representatives and lawmaker's staff. They have\n\nIn the end, if the game plays out correctly, low income individuals will still payer higher taxes, large companies will pay less taxes, but it will sound a lot like the opposite is occurring. You'll be happy and the economy will be slightly less screwed than if we listened to you and made companies actually pay 30% - 40% of their income directly to the treasury trough.\n\nTaxing corporations doesn't really gain you anything. If you shift 100% of the tax burden to individuals, they give up x% of their money to the government. If you shift 100% of the tax burden to corporations, the people still give up x% of their money to the government, just in the form of higher prices and lower wages. Income (money) is just a representation of productivity, and the only source of productivity is people. Corporations are just organizational groupings of people. Remove the people and the corporation's productivity is zero.\n\nThere are good reasons to tax corporations - excise taxes to pay for regulation enforcement, VATs to discourage middlemen, etc., and in this particular case to prevent shifting of tax revenue out of countries where the purchase transactions were actually made. But taxing corporations doesn't magically increase government revenue or the purchasing power of individuals. Corporate taxes are still paid for entirely by you and me - we just pay them indirectly via higher prices and lower wages, instead of directly to the government.\n\nThat's true to an extent, but the problem as I see it is that these large corporations are more able to use these tax avoidance strategies than smaller businesses and start ups. This means that they not only have economies of scale on their side but also a reduced tax burden. Smaller firms will thus be less able to compete and innovation is stifled. Eliminating corporation tax could be one way around this, but as you say, this would bring its own set of problems.\n\nI'm surprised to read someone who realizes that taxing a corporation is just a hidden income tax. Well said.\n\nI disagree that there are good reasons for the Federals to tax corporations, because I recommend the Feds only being allowed to tax states directly, in proportion to their population and no other taxes, exemptions, subsidies or anything.\n\nYou are simplifying things too much. In a global economy companies like Apple may have next to no employees in Europe while collecting large amounts of profit selling goods manufactured by workers in China. Thus their income tax exposure in Europe is next to zero while their corporate tax exposure is actually quite large.\n\nThen there is the other side of the coin: small and mid sized companies that actually pay the corporate taxes which are at a competitive disadvantage because they have more tax expenses tha\n\nTaxing corporations doesn't really gain you anything. If you shift 100% of the tax burden to individuals, they give up x% of their money to the government. If you shift 100% of the tax burden to corporations, the people still give up x% of their money to the government, just in the form of higher prices and lower wages.\n\nThis is what the 0.01% want us to believe, so they can keep corporate taxes low. It is, however, a very blatant lie.\n\nThere are two ways that corporations can compensate higher corporate taxes. One is the way you allude, by passing the burden on to their employees and customers. But it's not the only way. They could also take a hit to their profits, which quite frankly are obscene:\n\nI've been thinking lately that perhaps corporate income tax should indeed go away, and that we wouldn't be any worse off for it... if we started treating capital gains the same as regular income, and tax it accordingly (I'd actually argue that it should even be taxed higher than wages, because it's economic rent, not a payment for the contribution of productive labor - but I'd be okay with a single scale).\n\nThat's an old thought, but won't work. The reason is that people who have these insane amounts of money don't need to draw it as income. They can purchase things with stocks they own, for example. They can keep it \"invested\". Your tax gain would be much less than you anticipate, and of course there would be some exceptions and loopholes and they would be abused.\n\nIf you want to return the world back to a different age where humans matter more than corporations, you have to tax the corporations high and the hu\n\nAre you specifically referring to the scheme that Steve Jobs used? The one where he'd basically take loans using his billions of stock as collateral, never paying them out, and then once he dies, his family inherits the stock, sells it (and now pays no tax on capital gains, because it's considered \"reset\"?), and repays the loans? That's just a straight loophole that we should close.\n\nI wasn't referring to that scheme in particular, because there are many such and I was referring to them in general.\n\nBecause once you're super-rich, the rules of the game change. From what I gather from friends working in various industries that serve the 0.01%, these people have more ways of hiding their money then you and I have of making money.\n\nThis assumes that prices and wages are set based on profit margins. Clearly they are not. Prices are what the market will stand, Apple being the perfect example of huge margins even though other companies make equivalent or better products for far less. Wages are as low as the minimum amount required to get people to do the job required, and because welfare systems make up any shortfall that is often below what a person can live on without assistance. Essentially it's corporate welfare, as the corporation r\n\nThis will end up as just another pointless \"look, we actually do something!\" PR stunt, with the inevitable outcome of a token \"no admission of wrongdoing\" fine that amounts to 30 seconds' worth of Apple's profits and probably doesn't even pay for the \"investigation\".\n\nI don't like that multinationals have perfected the art of gaming the world's tax systems, but I highly doubt Apple (and others) actually broke any laws here. Intra-company licensing fees make it trivial to shuffle both income and expenses ar\n\nthe UK parliament is rather upset about it, assorted companies have been asked grumpy questions about their tax avoidance, in particular Google. The problem is closing these loopholes requires a lot of international cooperation and it isn't generally in the interests of the smaller countries to play ball.\n\nIreland's taxation laws allow multinationals to set up subsidiaries that effectively turn them into stateless entities whose revenues are subject to no jurisdiction. It's the definition of entirely legal tax avoidance, and Apple has been among the most successful companies in routing much of its international revenues and earnings through its Irish subsidiaries.\n\nApple has conspired with the Irish government to move it's profit outside the space/time continuum. How else can you explain \"revenues are subject to no jurisdiction?\" That means the money has no legal presence anywhere on the planet. Or off the planet, as far as we know.\n\nThere are lots of locations where the rule of law doesn't apply. There are places where many different legal systems claim to be in charge. There are places like Antarctica where the international community has set up treaties so that one one country has control. Apple has been able to secrete it's money so it is not in any of these places.\n\nThey have outflanked the rule of law. They are in a literal sense \"lawless\": without law. Yet they make extensive use of the legal system and expect to have their business protected by civil and criminal authorities. It's corporate hypocrisy at it's most blatant.\n\nWhy are they getting away with this? I have a counter suggestion: round up all current and former living board members, everyone who was a Chief Executive Anything, put them in indefinite detention and strip them of every asset they have. Why do the deserve legal protection when they have made it their business to be above the law?\n\nThat's a nice patent portfolio you've got there. You say your entire business model hinges on intellectual property, some ephemera that requires a court system to adjudicate? And maybe some Customs officers to block infringing devices from the US market?\n\nWhy, it'd be a shame if the courts and Customs didn't help. Kind of hard to be exclusive with just a bunch of paper backing you up..\n\nOf course, you report that income and pay those taxes, that's maybe something we could help you with.\n\nIt's not a racket, since it does actually provide meaningful protection in return for those taxes. If you want to experience what it's like when there's no such protection, you can try living in Somalia or in Tribal Territories for a year or two, and see if you still think the deal is worthless.\n\nOne classic way of using these companies is buying and selling through them, which means that the owner does not need to report international operations conducted through the shell company and will be able to avoid any taxes on the profits. Shell companies are also used to conduct various other pieces of shady business, including selling supermarket brand goods without impacting the value of the main brand.\n\nThis is very bad for the Netherlands. It was in the paper this morning that because we are a tax paradise, especially for American companies, the Fortune 500 companies have 127 billion dollars stashed up in our country. If now suddenly the EU starts to meddle with the way we do business, this money may vanish and we lose a lucrative and easy part of our yearly income.\n\nNot really. What is happening is that in most countries tax collection went down and they either increased taxes or cut services or both to compensate. Guess why they are collecting less taxes? Because companies like Apple are not paying their taxes! Guess who is getting taxed the most to compensate? consumers and hired labour.\n\nTax havens exist for all sorts of reasons. In a country like the Netherlands where a large part of GDP is natural gas exports the government can live off that and cut some corporate t", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The present invention relates to a signal transmission device which is used to electrically connect an auxiliary device provided on a steering wheel side of a vehicle to a wiring harness which is provided on the vehicle body side.\nAs a signal transmission device which supplies electricity to an auxiliary device provided on a rotating steering wheel, there is also available a signal transmission device which employs a sliding contact system. However, for example, in an air bag system mounted onto a steering wheel, such sliding contacts can be cut off instantaneously, proving fatal to the air bag system. For this reason, a highly reliable cable type of electric connecting device, a Steering Roller Connector (SRC) is employed.\nHere, FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a conventional column and FIG. 2 is a section view of the column shown in FIG. 1 taken along the axial direction of a steering unit including a steering roller connector. An SRC 1 comprises an outer cylinder 3 which is a fixed member, and an inner cylinder 5 which is a rotating member and is coaxial with the outer cylinder 3. Outer cylinder 3 and inner cylinder 5 define an annular storage chamber which houses an electrical cable 6 stored in a spiral manner. One end of the cable 6 is guided out from the outer cylinder 3 and is connected to a wiring harness provided on the vehicle body side, while the other end of the cable 6 is guided out from the inner cylinder 5 and is connected to an auxiliary device such as a horn switch, a steering switch, or a squib provided in an inflator. The SRC 1 can be fixed to a column 9 in such a manner that a fixing portion 7 provided on the outer periphery of the outer cylinder 3 is fixed to a screw hole 11 formed in the column 9.\nThe column 9 includes a pair of connector storage portions 13 which are respectively formed on the two side surfaces thereof; and, a lever unit, such as a turn signal lever 15 or a wiper control switch 17, is mounted into one of the corresponding connector storage portions 13. Also, a canceler 19 is assembled to the column 9.\nThe canceler 19 includes an engaging projection 27 on the upper surface thereof and, in order to prevent its relative rotation to the SRC 1, the engaging projection 27 is engaged with the lower surface of the inner cylinder 5 of the SRC 1. Also, the canceler 19 can be rotated integrally with the steering and thus, if the canceler 19 is rotated integrally with steering, then it not only transmits the rotation of the steering to the inner cylinder 5 of the SRC 1 but also brings a canceler portion 23 into contact with a return portion 25 provided in a turn signal cancel mechanism (not shown) to thereby return or cancel the turn signal lever 15 to its neutral position. Between the canceler 19 and a base plate 29 provided in the column 9, there is interposed a spring 31 which is used to energize the canceler 19 toward the SRC 1. With this structure, even when the SRC 1 is mounted at a position where the engaging projection 27 is not engaged, the canceler 19 can be moved in the steering axial direction against the energizing force of the spring 31, thereby being able to prevent itself against breakage.\nHowever, in the above-mentioned conventional column structure, since the SRC 1 is disposed on the column 9, the canceler 19 is disposed on the lower surface of the column 9 in such a manner that it can be moved in the steering axial direction, and the spring 31 is used to energize the canceler 19 toward the SRC 1, a wide space is required which extends in the steering axial direction and is used to store these component parts. This not only increases the size of the column structure, but also increases the number of parts to be disposed in the steering axial direction, thus increasing the number of man-hours required for assembly. Also, when the SRC 1 is stored within the column 9, because of the limited space, the cancel system must be replaced with an electronic system, which further increases the number of parts required as well as the cost of the whole device.\nFurther, since the spring load of the spring 31 is applied to the sliding surfaces of the spring 31 and the canceler 19, there is a friction loss in rotation, which in turn degrades the operating feeling of the steering.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

A Saudi-led coalition has been trying to restore Yemen’s internationally recognized government to power, but the conflict is stalemated, with the Houthis still in control of Sanaa and much of the north.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council on Tuesday that Yemen remains “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis” with three-quarters of the population - over 22 million people - urgently needing humanitarian help including 8.4 million struggling to find their next meal.\n\nBefore the war, Yemen relied on imports for 90 percent of its staple food, medicine and fuel but Lowcock said delays at ports and shortages have led to sharp increases in the price of food and household necessities, forcing hundreds of thousands of destitute families to turn to humanitarian aid to survive.\n\nFaite said “humanitarian aid will not be the solution.”\n\n“Economic life is key,” he said. “A country cannot run on humanitarian assistance. … What is also vitally important is that commercial items, imports, commercial life, is really allowed to resume.”\n\nFaite said it’s critically important that political and military authorities allow essential goods into all areas of Yemen.\n\n“The conduct of military operations is bad enough,” Faite said, but the indirect effects of the war on Yemen’s crumbling infrastructure, the failure to pay health workers, teachers and civil servants, “is really impacting the life of the everyday Yemeni.”\n\nAs an example of the dire situation, Faite said, the ICRC is supporting six kidney dialysis centers in the north where no others are functioning, and it also has been providing insulin to Yemenis with diabetes.\n\nFor people whose lives depend on this, if “you don’t get it one week, the next week you will not be around,” he said.\n\nThe war has also damaged power plants and it’s estimated that only 10 percent of Yemenis have access to power in towns and cities, Faite said. So generators are crucial not only for electricity but to run pumping stations for water supplies.\n\nHe said the ICRC and the U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, have joined forces so that when there’s a breakdown “we repair the pumps, they repair the generators of the pumping stations.”\n\n“If this was not done with UNICEF providing the fuel, it’s not very clear if there would be running water in the city, if there would be running water at all,” Faite said.\n\nFaite said all parties need to sit down to see what can be done to speed up commercial shipping, especially in the northern port of Hodeida.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Spring is just around the corner after all.”\n\nIn anticipation of the week’s protests, another Cambridge colleges, St Catharine’s, closed the main gate leading to its 17th-century court over concerns that protesters would set up a campsite on the grass.\n\n“One of Extinction Rebellions oppositions is to green space being kept behind walls and only accessible to those in power and privilege,” said an email sent to students by the college’s head porter.\n\n“Although our main court is actually open for viewing, there is a concern they may try to take it over and possibly camp on it.”\n\nEarlier this year, a group of students at the University of Oxford set up a camp in the front quad of St John’s for five days in protest against the college’s investment in fossil fuel companies.\n\nInspired by this, climate protesters in Cambridge put up tents on the lawn in front of King’s.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Modeling of Droplet Impact onto Polarized and Nonpolarized Dielectric Surfaces.\nThis paper is concerned with simulation of the droplet impact on a dielectric surface, referred to as the dynamic electrowetting-on-dielectric (DEWOD). In particular, we seek to shed more light on the fundamental processes occurring during the impact of an electrically conducting droplet onto a dielectric surface with and without an applied voltage. The liquid in the droplet is an ionic conductor (a leaky dielectric). This work employs an approach based on Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) modeling. The simulations are validated by predicting the equilibrium contact angle, droplet oscillations, and charge density estimation. Then, four cases of droplet impact are studied, namely, the impact onto a surface with no voltage applied and the impacts onto the surfaces with 2, 4, and 6 kV applied. The modeling results of water droplet impact allow for direct comparison with the experimental results reported by Lee et al. [ Langmuir 2013, 29, 7758]. The results reveal the electric field, the body forces acting on the droplet, the velocity and pressure fields inside and outside the droplet, as well as the free charge density and the electric energy density. The model predicts the droplet shape evolution (e.g., the spreading distance over the surface and the rebound height) under different conditions that are consistent with the experimental observations. Thus, our findings provide new qualitative and quantitative insights into the droplet manipulation that can be used in novel applications of the DEWOD phenomenon.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "So when the Disney signups came around I was STOKED because I participated last year, got no gift, and there weren't enough rematchers. :(\n\nSo imagine my disappointment when the shipping deadline passes and I get no tracking and no messages...but lo and behold! There's a rematch Santa for me! She messaged me right away saying how sorry she was I got shafted and she'd go shopping soon. Everything came from Florida, and from the shipping address it looks like she lives a little over TWO HOURS from Orlando, so holy crap she drove all that way to get me stuff and there was A LOT of it (she sent a note saying she got everything from Disney World)! I can't imagine how much she spent....\n\nThe first thing I pull out of the box is just. Perfect. I'd mentioned in my notes about me that I love keeping warm (favorite characters listed were Ariel and Maleficent as well), and I got MERMAID SOCKS! Then right on top is a little cute Ariel note pad. I don't think I mentioned my obsession with note pads in my notes, so she nailed it with this one! (seriously, there are at least 3 note pads on my desk right now) Then I see a little thingie that is not within the Little Mermaid color scheme, and I pull it out and omg it's an adorable Maleficent Tsum Tsum! It's just too cute. Then there's a lot of stuff wrapped in tissue paper and a little box. I pull the first little thing of tissue paper out and it's a wonderful Ariel key chain, it's just so pretty! Inside the little box was an absolutely beautiful charm bracelet too. Then there was a rather large/bulky item wrapped in tissue paper...it's an insulated tumbler! I'd mentioned how much I love them and drink my (cold) coffee from them daily, and she just nailed it AGAIN! I can't believe she found one this large, because all of the Little Mermaid ones I'd found are like 6oz and for kids, but this one's adult sized!\n\nI can't believe the thought, time, consideration, AND money that went into these lovely gifts, and you should all give her all the rewards!", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Comparison of Mg-ATP, Ca-ATP, and metal ion-free ATP-actin.\nThe fluorescence of N-acetyl-N'-(sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (AEDANS) covalently bound to Cys-374 of actin is used as a probe for different conformational states of G-actin according to whether Ca-ATP, Mg-ATP, or unchelated ATP is bound to the nucleotide site. Upon addition of large amounts (greater than 10(2)-fold molar excess) of EDTA to G-actin, metal ion-free ATP-G-actin is obtained with EDTA bound. Metal ion free ATP-G-actin is characterized by a higher AEDANS fluorescence than Mg-ATP-G-actin, which itself has a higher fluorescence than Ca-ATP-G-actin. Evidence for EDTA binding to G-actin is shown using difference spectrophotometry. Upon binding of EDTA, the rate of dissociation of the divalent metal ion from G-actin is increased (2-fold for Ca2+, 10-fold for Mg2+) in a range of pH from 7.0 to 8.0. A model is proposed that quantitatively accounts for the kinetic data. The affinity of ATP is weakened 10(6)-fold upon removal of the metal ion.

{"text": "Non-volatile memory is memory that can retain data and information even when power is not applied. An example of non-volatile memory that is being used in a variety of applications, such as cellular phone technology, is “flash memory.” Flash memory is a form of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), where data can be written in bytes and erased in blocks of memory. The blocks of memory typically range from 8 kBytes to 1 MByte in size. The cell density of flash memory devices can be very high, often as high as conventional dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells, since in conventional flash memory a single floating gate structure is used for each memory cell. Flash memory devices also have relatively fast data access times. In the past, flash memory has been used in applications such as storing basic input/output system (BIOS) information in personal computers. However, with improvements in programming capabilities, and the continually increasing demand for persistent and low-power memory devices, the application of flash memory in many other areas has expanded very rapidly.\nAs previously mentioned, one such application is in cellular phones. At one time, cellular phones were only limited to voice communication. Now, cellular phones provide Internet access and web browsing capabilities, allow a user to capture and store computer graphic images, capture and playback video, and provide personal digital assistant (PDA) capabilities. As a consequence, cellular phones need to be able to store different types of data and information. For example, whereas older cellular phones would only need to store data representing phone numbers, newer cellular phones need to store phone numbers, voice information, graphics images, small applications (e.g., Java applets) downloaded from the Internet, and the like.\nThe various data objects that must be stored by the flash memory have different characteristics. For example, data such as phone numbers are generally small segments of data having uniform length. Other data can be variable in length, such as voice information, where the amount of memory used depends on the length of voice information recorded. Data can be packetized, as in the case where data is downloaded from the Internet. Additionally, the amount of memory consumed by data such as voice information, and image files, can be considerable, spanning multiple blocks of flash memory. Application code, such as a Java applet, is unique in that the binary code must be stored contiguously in flash memory to allow for the code to be executed by a processor directly from the flash memory.\nFlash memory, which is non-volatile, and has low operating power, is perfectly suited for data and information storage applications such as in cellular phones where conservation of power is very desirable. However, the operating characteristics of flash memory must be adapted to facilitate storage of the different types of data and information previously described.\nFlash memory, although providing many of the characteristics required for applications in portable and remote (wireless) devices, has unique operational characteristics that need to be considered. For example, because of the floating gate structure of conventional flash memory cells, data cannot be simply overwritten. The memory cells must be erased prior to writing new data. Also, as previously mentioned, flash memory devices are designed to erase data in blocks of memory cells, rather than on a cell-by-cell basis. Thus, although only a portion of the memory cells of a block need to be updated, the entire block must first be erased before programming the new data. The process of erasing an entire block of memory cells and programming new data takes a relatively long time to complete, and deferring an erase operation is often desirable. Additionally, erasing the entire block is a problem, however, in the case where another portion of the memory cells of the block do not need to be updated. Another issue related to flash, and other floating gate memory devices, is that these memory cells have a limited life-cycle where repeated cycles of erasing and programming degrade memory cell performance. Eventually, the cell performance is degraded to such a degree that the memory cell can no longer be used to store data.\nIn an effort to facilitate the use of flash products in applications such as cellular phones, memory management software interfaces have been developed to make the management of data storage in flash devices transparent to the user. The memory management software carries out various operations in the flash memory such as managing code, data and files, reclaiming memory when insufficient erased memory is available for programming new data, and wear-leveling flash blocks to increase cycling endurance. Memory management typically includes functions to support storage of parameter data for EEPROM replacement, data streams for voice recordings and multimedia, Java applets and native code for direct execution, and packetized data downloads. In addition to these operations, the memory management software often ensures that in the event of a power loss, previously programmed data is not lost or corrupted. An example of this type of memory management software is Intel® Flash Data Integrator (FDI) software.\nAlthough conventional flash memory management software has succeeded in increasing the flexibility of flash memory, there is still room for additional improvement. Conventional memory management software has limitations in the area of data management. For example, in some conventional flash memory management software, the memory space of a flash device is partitioned into fixed memory address ranges and either code or data is associated with each of the ranges. Once set at compile time, the range and the type of associated data cannot be changed without recompilation. Consequently, if at a later time a different partitioning between code and data is desired, the ranges defined for the two types of data cannot be modified unless software is recompiled. Additionally, although different flash memory management software performs many of the same functions, the process by which the functions are performed can be very different, with some being more efficient or providing a greater level of data integrity than others. For example, where information regarding the mapping of data within a memory is maintained in a single table corresponding to one physical block of flash memory, corruption of the single table, such as in the event of a power failure during a write operation to the table, will leave the flash memory device in a questionable state. Another example is using only a single physical block of flash memory to aid in the reclamation process, which may result in an inefficient iterative write and erase when the data objects stored in memory are large and which may corrupt the data objects if interrupted by a power loss. Therefore, there is a need for alternative memory management processes that can be implemented flash memory devices.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

[@kumar2009asymptotic] showed that the MMSE linear receivers, widely used for their simplicity, exhibit a largely suboptimal DMT in flat fading MIMO channels. Nonetheless, for a finite data rate (i.e. when the rate does not increase with the signal to noise ratio), the MMSE receivers take several diversity values, depending on the aimed rate, as noticed earlier in [@hedayat2005linear], and also in [@hedayat2004outage; @tajer2007diversity] for frequency-selective MIMO channels. In particular they achieve full diversity for sufficiently low data rates, hence their great interest. This behavior was partially explained in [@kumar2009asymptotic; @mehana2010diversity] for flat fading MIMO channels and in [@mehana2011diversity] for frequency-selective MIMO channels. Indeed the proof of the upper bound on the diversity order for the flat fading case given in [@mehana2010diversity] contains a gap, and the approach of [@mehana2010diversity] based on the Specht bound seems to be unsuccessfull. As for MIMO frequency selective channels with cyclic prefix, [@mehana2011diversity] only derives the diversity in the particular case of a number of channel taps equal to the transmission data block length, and claims that this value provides an upper bound in more realistic cases, whose expression is however not explicitly given. In this paper we provide a rigorous proof of the diversity for MMSE receivers in flat fading MIMO channels for finite data rates. We also derive the diversity in MIMO frequency selective channels with cyclic prefix for finite data rates if the transmission data block length is large enough. Simulations corroborate our derived diversity in the frequency selective channels case.\n\nProblem statement\n=================\n\nWe consider a MIMO system with $M$ transmitting, $N \\geq M$ receiving antennas, with coding and ideal interleaving at the transmitter, and with a MMSE linear equalizer at the receiver, followed by a de-interleaver and a decoder (see Fig. \\[fig:scheme\\]). We evaluate in the following sections the achieved diversity by studying the outage probability, that is the probability that the capacity does not support the target data rate, at high SNR regimes. We denote $\\rho$ the SNR, $I$ the capacity and $R$ the target data rate. We use the notation $\\doteq$ for [*exponential equality*]{} [@zheng2003diversity], i.e. $$f(\\rho) \\doteq \\rho^d\n \\Leftrightarrow\n \\lim_{\\rho \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log f(\\rho)}{\\log \\rho}= d,\n \\label{eq:exp-equ}$$ and the notations $\\dot\\leq$ and $\\dot\\geq$ for exponential inequalities, which are similarly defined. We note $\\log$ the logarithm to base $2$.\n\n![image](div_sch3){width=\"6.5in\"}\n\nFlat fading MIMO channels\n=========================\n\nIn this section we consider a flat fading MIMO channel. The output of the MIMO channel is given by $$\\y= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{M}} \\H \\x + \\n,$$ where $\\n \\sim \\mathcal{CN}({\\boldsymbol}{0},\\I_N)$ is the additive white Gaussian noise and $\\x$ the channel input vector, $\\H$ the $N \\times M$ channel matrix with i.i.d. entries $\\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$.\n\nFor a rate $R$ such that $\\log \\frac{M}{m} < \\frac{R}{M} < \\log \\frac{M}{m-1}$, with $m \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots, M \\}$, the outage probability verifies $$\\PP(I<R) \\doteq \\rho^{-m(N-M+m)},$$ that is, a diversity of $m(N-M+m)$.\n\nNote that for a rate $R < M \\log \\frac{M}{M-1}$ (i.e. $m=M$) full diversity $MN$ is attained, while for a rate $R > M \\log M$ the diversity corresponds to the one derived by DMT approach. This result was stated by [@mehana2010diversity]. Nevertheless the proof of the outage lower bound in [@mehana2010diversity] omits that the event noted $\\mathcal{B}_a$ is not independent from the eigenvalues of $\\H^H\\H$, hence questioning the validity of the given proof. We thus provide an alternative proof based on an approach suggested by the analysis of [@kumar2009asymptotic] in the case where $R = r \\log \\rho$ with $r  > 0$.\n\nThe capacity $I$ of the MIMO MMSE considered system is given by $$I = \\sum_{j=1}^M \\log ( 1 + \\beta_j),$$ where $\\beta_j$ is the SINR for the $j$th stream: $$\\beta_j= \\frac{1}{\\left(  \\left[ \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right]^{-1} \\right)_{jj} } - 1.$$ We lower bound in the first place $\\PP(I<R)$ and prove in the second place that the bound is tight by upper bounding $\\PP(I<R)$ with the same bound.\n\nLower bound of the outage probability {#sec:lowB_flat}\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe here assume that $R/M>\\log (M/m$). In order to lower bound $\\PP(I<R)$ we need to upper bound the capacity $I$. Using Jensen’s inequality on function $x \\mapsto \\log x$ yields $$\\begin{aligned}\n    I\n    &\\leq M \\log  \\Bigg[ \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M  \\left( 1+\\beta_j \\right) \\Bigg] \\label{ineq:jensen1}\n    \\\\\n    &= M \\log  \\Bigg[ \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M   \\bigg( \\left[  \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} \\bigg)^{-1} \\Bigg]. \\label{ineq:logconcave}\n \\end{aligned}$$ We note $\\H^*\\H= \\U^*\\Lambda\\U$ the SVD of $\\H^*\\H$ with $\\Lambda=\\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_M)$, $\\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M$. We recall that the $(\\lambda_k)_{k=1, \\ldots, M}$ are independent from the entries of matrix $\\U$ and that $\\U$ is a Haar distributed unitary random matrix, i.e. the probability distribution of $\\U$ is invariant by left (or right) multiplication by deterministic matrices. Using this SVD we can write $$\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M    \\bigg( \\left[  \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} \\bigg)^{-1}    = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M   \\bigg(  \\sum_{k=1}^M \\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k }  \\bigg)^{-1}. \\label{eq:sumSINR}\n$$\n\n### Case m=1\n\nIn order to better understand the outage probability behavior, we first consider the case $m=1$. In this case $R/M>\\log M$. We review the approach of [@kumar2009asymptotic III], which consists in upper bounding by $\\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M  \\frac{1}{|\\U_{1j}|^2}$, as $\\sum_{k=1}^M \\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k } \\geq \\frac{|\\U_{1j}|^2}{1+\\frac{\\rho}{M}\\lambda_1}$. Using this bound in gives $$I \\leq M \\log  \\bigg[  \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{1}{|\\U_{1j}|^2} \\bigg].$$ Therefore $$\\Big( \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{1}{|\\U_{1j}|^2} < 2^{R/M}  \\Big) \\subset (I<R).$$ In order to lower bound $\\PP(I<R)$, [@kumar2009asymptotic] introduced the set $$\\mathcal{A}_1 =  \\bigg\\{ \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{1}{|\\U_{1j}|^2} < M + \\eps \\bigg\\}$$ for $\\eps > 0$. Then, $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(I <R)\n  & \\geq \\PP\\left( (I<R) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_1 \\right)\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq \\PP \\bigg[   \\bigg( \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{1}{|\\U_{1j}|^2} < 2^{R/M}  \\bigg) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_1\\bigg]\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq \\PP \\left[   \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{M+\\eps} \\right) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_1\\right]\n  \\\\\n  & =  \\PP(\\mathcal{A}_1) \\cdot \\PP\\left[  1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1  < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{M+\\eps} \\right],\n \\end{aligned}$$ where the last equality comes from the independence between eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Gaussian matrix $\\H^*\\H$. It is shown in [@kumar2009asymptotic Appendix A] that $\\PP(\\mathcal{A}_1) \\neq 0$. Besides, as we supposed $2^{R/M}>M$, we can take $\\eps$ such that $\\frac{2^{R/M}}{M+\\eps}>1$, ensuring that $\\PP\\Big[ \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_1 \\right) < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{M+\\eps} \\Big] \\neq 0$. Hence there exists $\\kappa>0$ such that $$\\PP(I<R)  \\ \\dot\\geq  \\ \\PP\\left( \\lambda_1 < \\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho} \\right),$$ which is asymptotically equivalent to $\\rho^{-(N-M+1)}$ in the sense of (see, e.g., [@jiang2011performance Th. II.3]).\n\n### General case 1&lt;=m&lt;= M\n\nBy the same token as for $m=1$ we now consider the general case – we recall that we assumed that $\\log (M/m) < R/M$. We first lower bound $\\sum_k\\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k}$ which appears in by the $m$ first terms of the sum and then use Jensen’s inequality applied on $x \\mapsto x^{-1}$, yielding $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\sum_{k=1}^M \\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k}\n  &\\geq \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k}\n  \\\\\n  &\\geq \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{l=1}^m |\\U_{lj}|^2 \\right)^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^m |\\U_{kj}|^2 \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)}.\n \\end{aligned}$$ Using this inequality in , we obtain that $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M    \\bigg( \\left[  \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} \\bigg)^{-1}\n     \\leq \\frac{1}{M} & \\sum_{j=1}^M \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^m |\\U_{kj}|^2\\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)}{\\left( \\sum_{l=1}^m |\\U_{lj}|^2 \\right)^2} \\notag\n     \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{k=1}^m  \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)  \\delta_k(\\U), \\label{ineq:intr_delta}\n \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\delta_k(\\U) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M  \\frac{|\\U_{kj}|^2}{\\left( \\sum_{l=1}^m |\\U_{lj}|^2 \\right)^2}$. Equation , together with , yields the following inclusion: $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m  \\delta_k(\\U) \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)  <   2^{R/M} \\Bigg)\n  \\subset (I<R).\n \\end{aligned}$$ Similarly to the case $m=1$, we introduce the set $\\mathcal{A}_m$ defined by $$\\mathcal{A}_m =  \\left\\{ \\delta_k(\\U) < \\frac{M}{m^2} + \\eps, \\ \n    k=1,\\ldots,m \\right\\}$$ for $\\eps > 0$. We now use this set to lower bound $\\PP(I<R)$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(I<R) & \\geq \\PP\\left( (I<R) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_m \\right)\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq \\PP \\bigg[   \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m  \\delta_k(\\U) \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)  <   2^{R/M} \\Bigg) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_m\\bigg]\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq \\PP \\left[   \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k\\right)  <  \\frac{2^{R/M}}{\\frac{M}{m^2} + \\eps} \\Bigg) \\cap \\mathcal{A}_m\\right]\n  \\\\\n  &= \\PP(\\mathcal{A}_m) \\cdot \\PP\\left[  \\sum_{k=1}^m \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k  \\right) < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{\\frac{M}{m^2}+\\eps} \\right].\n \\end{aligned}$$ The independence between eigenvectors and eigenvalues of Gaussian matrix $\\H^*\\H$ justifies the last equality. As we assumed that $\\log(M/m) < R/M$, that is $m < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{M/m^2}$, we can choose $\\eps$ such that $m < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{M/m^2 +\\eps}$. That ensures that $\\PP\\left[  \\sum_{k=1}^m \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k  \\right) < \\frac{2^{R/M}}{ M/m^2 +\\eps} \\right] \\neq 0$. We show in Appendix \\[apx:prob\\_sum\\_first\\_ev\\] that this probability is asymptotically equivalent to $\\rho^{-m(N-M+m)}$ in the sense of , leading to $$\\PP(I<R) \\ \\dot\\geq \\  \\frac{\\PP(\\mathcal{A}_m)}{\\rho^{m(N-M+m)}}.\n    \\label{ineq:P_I<R}$$\n\nWe still need to prove that $\\PP(\\mathcal{A}_m) \\neq 0$. Any Haar distributed random unitary matrix can be parameterized by $M^2$ independent angular random variables $(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_{M^2})={\\boldsymbol}\\alpha$ whose probability distributions are almost surely positive (see [@dita2003factorization; @lundberg2004haar] and Appendix \\[apx:ang\\_par\\]). We note $\\Phi_m$ the functions such that $\\U=\\Phi_m({\\boldsymbol}\\alpha)$. Consider a deterministic unitary matrix $\\U_*$ such that $|(\\U_*)_{ij}|^2 = \\frac{1}{M} \\ \\forall i,j$, and denote by ${\\boldsymbol}\\alpha_*$ a corresponding $M^2$ dimensional vector. It is straightforward to check that $\\delta_k \\circ \\Phi_m (\\alpha_*) = M / m^2$. Functions ${\\boldsymbol}\\alpha \\mapsto (\\delta_k \\circ \\Phi_m)({\\boldsymbol}\\alpha)$ are continuous at point ${\\boldsymbol}\\alpha_*$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq m$ and therefore there exists $\\eta>0$ such that the ball $\\mathcal{B} \\left( {\\boldsymbol}\\alpha_*, \\eta \\right)$ is included in the set $\\left\\{ {\\boldsymbol}\\alpha, \\  (\\delta_k \\circ \\Phi_m)(\\alpha) < \\frac{M}{m^2}+\\eps, \\ k=1, \\ldots, m \\right\\}$. We have therefore $\\PP(\\mathcal{A}_m) \\neq 0$ as $$\\begin{aligned}\n   \\PP(\\mathcal{A}_m)\n   & = \\int_{\\left\\{ (\\delta_k \\,\\circ\\, \\Phi_m) ({\\boldsymbol}\\alpha) < \\frac{M}{m^2} + \\eps, \\, k=1, \\ldots, m \\right\\}} p({\\boldsymbol}\\alpha) d{\\boldsymbol}\\alpha\n   \\\\\n   & > \\int_{\\mathcal{B} \\left( {\\boldsymbol}\\alpha_*, \\eta \\right)} p({\\boldsymbol}\\alpha) d{\\boldsymbol}\\alpha > 0\n  \\end{aligned}$$ Coming back to , we eventually have $$\\PP(I<R) \\ \\dot\\geq \\ \\frac{1}{\\rho^{m(N-M+m)}},$$ that is the diversity of the MMSE receiver is upper bounded by $m(N-M+m)$.\n\nUpper bound of the outage probability {#sec:upper-flat}\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe now conclude by studying the upper bound of the outage probability, showing that $m(N-M+m)$ is also a lower bound for the diversity. Note that this lower bound has been derived in [@kumar2009asymptotic; @mehana2010diversity] using however rather informal arguments; we provide a more rigorous proof here for the sake of completeness.\n\nWe now assume that $R/M < \\log (M/(m-1))$, i.e. $m-1 < M 2^{-R/M}$. Using Jensen inequality on function $y \\mapsto \\log(1/y)$, the capacity $I$ can be lower bounded: $$\\begin{aligned}\n    I\n    &= - \\sum_{j=1}^M \\log \\left( \\left[ \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} \\right)\n    \\\\\n    &\\geq -M \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{M} \\Tr \\left[ \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right] \\right),\n  \\end{aligned}$$ which leads to an upper bound for the outage probability: $$\\PP(I<R) \n   \\leq \\PP \\left[ \\Tr \\left[ \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\right)^{-1} \\right] > M 2^{-R/M} \\right].\n   \\label{ineq:PP-B0}$$ We need to derive the probability in the right-hand side of the above inequality. Noting $\\mathcal{B}_0= \\left\\{ \\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M, \\ \\sum_{k=1}^M \\left( 1 +  \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\lambda_k  \\right)^{-1} > M 2^{-R/M} \\right\\}$, $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\PP  \\bigg[ \\Tr \\Big[ \\Big( \\I + & \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H^*\\H  \\Big)^{-1} \\Big] > M 2^{-R/M} \\bigg] \\notag\n    \\\\\n    & = \\int_{\\mathcal{B}_0} p(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M.\n    \\label{eq:int_B0_PP}\n  \\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe now introduce $\\mu_m =  \\sup_{(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{B}_0}\\{ \\rho \\,\\lambda_m \\}$ and prove by contradiction that $\\mu_m < +\\infty$. If $\\mu_m = +\\infty$, there exists a sequence $(\\lambda_1^{(n)}, \\lambda_2^{(n)}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M^{(n)})_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $\\lambda_k^{(n)} \\rightarrow +\\infty$ for any $k \\geq m$. Besides, $$M 2^{-R/M} \\mhs < \\sum_{k=1}^M \\mhs \\Big(  1+\\frac{\\rho}{M}\\lambda^{(n)}_k \\Big)^{-1} \\mhs \\leq (m-1) + \\sum_{k=m}^M \\mhs \\Big(1+\\frac{\\rho}{M}\\lambda^{(n)}_k\\Big)^{-1}.$$ In particular $M 2^{-R/M} < (m-1) + \\sum_{k=m}^M \\mhs \\big(1+\\frac{\\rho}{M}\\lambda^{(n)}_k\\big)^{-1} $, which, taking the limit when $n \\rightarrow +\\infty$, leads to $m-1 \\geq M 2^{-R/M}$, a contradiction with the assumption $m-1 < M 2^{-R/M}$. Hence, $\\mu_m < +\\infty$.\n\nWe introduce the set $\\mathcal{B}_1= \\{ \\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M, \\, 0 < \\lambda_k \\leq \\frac{\\mu_m}{\\rho}, \\, k=1,\\ldots,m \\}$, which verifies $\\mathcal{B}_0 \\subset \\mathcal{B}_1$. Using and , this implies that $$\\PP(I<R) \\leq \\int_{\\mathcal{B}_1} p(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M,$$ which is shown to be asymptotically smaller than $\\rho^{-m(N-M+m)}$ in the sense of in Appendix \\[apx:prob\\_first\\_ev\\_bounded\\]. The diversity is thus lower bounded by $m(N-M+m)$, ending the proof.\n\nFrequency selective MIMO channels with cyclic prefix {#sec:freqsel}\n====================================================\n\nWe consider a frequency selective MIMO channel with $L$ independent taps. We consider a block transmission cyclic prefix scheme, with a block length of $K$. The output of the MIMO channel at time $t$ is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\y_t =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{ML}}\\,\\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\H_l \\x_{t-l} +\\n_t\n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{ML}}\\,[\\H(z)] \\x_t +\\n_t\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\x_t$ is the channel input vector at time $t$, $\\n_t \\sim \\mathcal{CN}({\\boldsymbol}{0}, \\I_N)$ the additive white Gaussian noise, $\\H_l$ is the $N \\times M$ channel matrix associated to $l^{\\mathrm{th}}$ channel tap, for $l \\in \\{0,\\ldots, L-1\\}$, and $\\H(z)$ denotes the transfer function of the discrete-time equivalent channel defined by $$\\H(z) = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\H_l \\, z^{-l}.$$ We make the common assumption that the entries of $\\H_l$ are i.i.d and $\\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$ distributed. We can now state the second diversity theorem of the paper.\n\nAssume that the non restrictive condition $K > {M^{2}(L-1)}$ holds, ensuring that $\\log \\frac{M}{m} < -\\log\\big(\\frac{m-1}{M}+\\frac{(L-1)(M-(m-1))}{K}\\big)$ for any $m=1, \\ldots, M$. Then, for a rate $R$ verifying $$\\hspace{-11pt}\n \\textstyle\n  \\log \\frac{M}{m}\n  < \\frac{R}{M} <\n  -\\log \\left(\\frac{m-1}{M} + \\frac{(L-1)(M-(m-1))}{K}  \\right),\n \\label{eq:bounds_R_fsel}$$ $m \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots, M \\}$, the outage probability verifies $$\\PP(I<R) \\doteq \\rho^{-m(LN-M+m)},$$ that is a diversity of $m(LN-M+m)$.\n\nThe diversity of the MMSE receiver is thus $m(LN-M+m)$, corresponding to a flat fading MIMO channel with $M$ transmit antennas and $LN$ receive antennas. For a large block length $K$, the upper bound for rate $R$ is close to the bound of the previous flat fading case $\\log \\frac{M}{m-1}$. Concerning data rates verifying $\n -\\log\\big(\\frac{m-1}{M} + \\frac{L-1}{K} (M-(m-1))\\big)\n < \\frac{R}{M} <\n \\log \\frac{M}{m-1},\n$ the $m(LN-M+m)$ diversity is only an upper bound; nevertheless the diversity is also lower bounded by $(m-1)(LN-M+(m-1))$.\n\nSimilarly to previous section the capacity of the MIMO MMSE system is written $\n   I = \\sum_{j=1}^M \\log ( 1 + \\beta_j),\n  $ where $\\beta_j$ is the SINR for the $j$th stream of $\\x_t$. It is standard material that in MIMO frequency selective channel with cyclic prefix the SINR of the MMSE receiver is given by $$\\beta_j = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^K \\left[ \\left( \\S\\left(\\frac{k-1}{K}\\right)  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} } -1,\n  \\label{eq:SINR_freqsel}$$ where $\\S(\\nu)=  \\I_N + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu})^*\\H(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}) $.\n\nLower bound for the outage probability\n--------------------------------------\n\nWe assume that $R/M > \\log(M/m)$.\n\nOne can show that function $\\A \\mapsto (\\A^{-1})_{jj}$, defined over the set of positive-definite matrices, is convex. Using Jensen’s inequality then yields $$\\begin{aligned}\n   \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^K {\\textstyle \\left[ \\left( \\S\\left(\\frac{k-1}{K}\\right)  \\right)^{-1} \\right]_{jj} }\n   & \\geq \\bigg( \\bigg[ \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=1}^K {\\textstyle  \\S\\left(\\frac{k-1}{K}\\right) }\\bigg]^{-1} \\bigg)_{jj}\n   \\\\\n   & = \\bigg( \\bigg[ \\I_N +  \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H_l^*\\H_l \\bigg]^{-1} \\bigg)_{jj}.\n \\end{aligned}$$ The last equality follows from the fact that $\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{2 i\\pi \\frac{k-1}{K}(l-n)}=\\delta_{ln}$. Using this inequality in the SINR expression gives $$1+\\beta_j \\leq \\bigg( \\bigg( \\bigg[ \\I_N +  \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\H_l^*\\H_l  \\bigg]^{-1} \\bigg)_{jj} \\bigg)^{-1}.$$ We now come back to the capacity $I$ of the system; similarly to , using Jensen’s inequality yields $$\\begin{aligned}\n  I \n  & \\leq M \\log  \\Bigg[ \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M  \\left( 1+\\beta_j \\right) \\Bigg]\n  \\\\\n  & \\leq M \\log \\Bigg[  \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\bigg( \\bigg( \\bigg[ \\I_N +  \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\H_l^*\\H_l  \\bigg]^{-1} \\bigg)_{jj} \\bigg)^{-1} \\,\\Bigg].\n \\end{aligned}$$ We can now use the results of section \\[sec:lowB\\_flat\\] by simply replacing $N \\times M$ matrix $\\H$ in by $LN \\times M$ matrix $\\Hb=[\\H_0^T, \\H_1^T, \\ldots, \\H_{L-1}^T]^T$. They lead to the following lower bound for the outage capacity, for a rate $R$ verifying $R/M > \\log (M/m)$: $$\\PP(I<R) \\ \\dot\\geq \\ \\frac{1}{\\rho^{m(LN-M+m)}}.$$\n\nUpper bound for the outage probability\n--------------------------------------\n\nWe assume that $\\frac{R}{M} < -\\log\\big(\\frac{m-1}{M}+\\frac{(L-1)(M-(m-1))}{K}\\big)$, that is $2^{-R/M} < \\frac{m-1}{M} \\mhs + \\mhs \\frac{L-1}{K} (M \\mhs - \\mhs (m-1))$.\n\nWe first derive a lower bound for the capacity $I$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n  I & = - \\sum_{j=1}^M \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^K \\left( \\left[ {\\textstyle \\S\\left(\\frac{k-1}{K}\\right)} \\right]^{-1} \\right)_{jj}  \\right)\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq - M  \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{KM} \\sum_{k=1}^K \\Tr\\left( \\left[ {\\textstyle \\S\\left(\\frac{k-1}{K}\\right)} \\right]^{-1} \\right) \\right)\n \\end{aligned}$$ The latter inequality follows once again from Jensen’s inequality on function $x \\mapsto \\log x$.\n\nWe now analyze $\\Tr\\left(\\S(\\nu)^{-1}\\right)$. To that end, we write $LN \\times M$ matrix $\\Hb=[\\H_0^T, \\ldots, \\H_{L-1}^T]^T$ under the form $\\Hb={\\boldsymbol}\\Theta (\\Hb^*\\Hb)^{1/2}$, where ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta=[{\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_0^T, \\ldots, {\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_{L-1}^T]^T$ and ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^*{\\boldsymbol}\\Theta=\\I_M$. Besides, we note $\\U^*\\Lambda\\U$ the SVD of $\\Hb^*\\Hb$ with $\\Lambda=\\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_M)$, $\\lambda_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M$. Hence, $$\\H(e^{2 i\\pi \\nu})={\\boldsymbol}\\Theta(e^{2 i\\pi \\nu})\\U^*\\Lambda^{1/2}\\U,$$ where ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta(z)=\\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}{\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_l z^{-l}$. Using this parametrization, $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\Tr\\left(\\S(\\nu)^{-1}\\right)\n   &= \\Tr \\left[ \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\U {\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^*(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}){\\boldsymbol}\\Theta(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}) \\U^* \\Lambda \\right)^{-1} \\right]\n   \\\\\n   &\\leq \\Tr \\left[ \\left( \\I + \\frac{\\rho}{M} \\gamma(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}) \\Lambda \\right)^{-1} \\right],\n \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\gamma(\\nu)=\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}}({\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^*(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}){\\boldsymbol}\\Theta(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}))$. Coming back to the outage probability, $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(I<R) \\leq & \\PP \\mhs \\left[  \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\mhs \\left( \\mhs 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j }{M} \\gamma \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right) \\mhs \\right)^{\\mhs-1} \\mhs > M2^{-R/M}\\right] \\notag\n  \\\\ \n  &= \\PP \\mhs \\left[  \\Hb \\in \\mathcal{B}_0 \\right], \\label{ineq:PP-fs}\n \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\mathcal{B}_0 = \\big\\{ \\Hb, \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\mhs \\big( 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j }{M} \\gamma \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right)  \\big)^{-1} \\mhs > M2^{-R/M} \\big\\}$.\n\nWe now prove by contradiction that $\\mu_m < +\\infty$, where $\\mu_m =\\sup_{\\Hb \\in \\mathcal{B}_0} \\{ \\rho \\lambda_m \\}$. If $\\mu_m = +\\infty$ there exists a sequence of matrices $\\Hb^{(n)} \\mhs \\in \\mhs \\mathcal{B}_0$ such that $\\rho \\lambda_m^{(n)} \\rightarrow +\\infty$. Besides, $$\\begin{aligned}\n  M 2^{-\\frac{R}{M}}\n  & < \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=1}^M \\bigg( 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j^{(n)} }{M} \\gamma^{(n)} \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right)  \\bigg)^{\\mhs-1} \\notag\n  \\\\\n  & \\leq (m-1) + \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=m}^M \\bigg( 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j^{(n)} }{M} \\gamma^{(n)} \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right)  \\bigg)^{\\mhs-1}\n  \\label{ineq:mat-seq}\n \\end{aligned}$$ As ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^{(n)}$ belongs to a compact we can extract a subsequence ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^{(\\psi(n))}$ which converges towards a matrix ${\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_\\infty$. For this subsequence, inequality becomes $$M 2^{-\\frac{R}{M}}\n   \\leq (m-1) + \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{j=m}^M \\bigg( 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j^{(\\psi(n))} }{M} \\gamma^{(\\psi(n))} \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right)  \\bigg)^{-1}.\n   \\label{ineq:sumsum}$$ Let $\\gamma_\\infty$ be the function defined by $\\gamma_\\infty(\\nu)=\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}}({\\boldsymbol}\\Theta^*_\\infty(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}){\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_\\infty(e^{2 i \\pi \\nu}))$ and $k_1, \\ldots, k_p$ be the integers for which $\\gamma_{\\infty}(k_j/K) = 0$. Then $\\det {\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_\\infty(z) = \\det \\big( \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} {\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_{\\infty,l} z^{-l} \\big)=0$ for all $z \\in \\big\\{ e^{2 i \\pi k_j/K}, j=1,\\ldots,p \\big\\}$. Nevertheless, polynomial $z \\mapsto \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} {\\boldsymbol}\\Theta_{\\infty,l} z^{-l}$ has a maximum degree of $M(L-1)$, therefore $p \\leq M(L-1)$. Inequality then leads to $$M 2^{-\\frac{R}{M}}\n   \\leq (m-1) +  \\frac{M(L-1)}{K} \n    +\\frac{1}{K}  \\sum_{k\\notin\\{k_1, \\ldots, k_p\\}} \\sum_{j=m}^M \\bigg( 1 + \\frac{\\rho \\lambda_j^{(\\psi(n))} }{M} \\gamma^{(\\psi(n))} \\left( \\frac{k}{K} \\right)  \\bigg)^{\\mhs-1} \\label{ineq:M2-RMp}$$ Moreover, if $k \\notin \\{k_1, \\ldots, k_p\\}$, $\\lambda_j^{(\\psi(n))} \\gamma^{(\\psi(n))}(\\frac{k}{K}) \\rightarrow +\\infty$ for $j \\geq m$, as $\\gamma^{(\\psi(n))} \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right) \\rightarrow \\gamma_\\infty \\mhs\\left(\\frac{k}{K}\\right) \\neq 0$ for $k \\notin \\left\\{ k_1, \\ldots, k_p \\right\\}$. Therefore taking the limit of when $n \\rightarrow +\\infty$ gives $$M 2^{-\\frac{R}{M}}\n   \\leq (m-1) +  \\frac{M(L-1)}{K},$$ which is in contradiction with the original assumption $2^{-R/M} < \\mhs \\frac{m-1}{M} \\mhs + \\mhs \\frac{L-1}{K} (M \\mhs - \\mhs (m-1))$. Hence $\\mu_m < +\\infty$, and $\\mathcal{B}_0 \\subset \\mathcal{B}_1= \\{ \\Hb, \\rho \\lambda_m(\\Hb^*\\Hb) < \\mu_m \\}$. Using , we thus have $$\\PP(I<R) \\leq \\PP(\\Hb \\in \\mathcal{B}_1),$$ which, by Appendix \\[apx:prob\\_first\\_ev\\_bounded\\], is asymptotically smaller than $\\rho^{-m(NL-M+m)}$ in the sense of , therefore ending the proof.\n\nNumerical Results\n=================\n\nWe here illustrate the derived diversity in the frequency selective case. In the conducted simulation we took a block length of $K=64$, a number of transmitting and receiving antennas $M=N=2$, $L=2$ channel taps and an aimed data rate $R=3$ bits/s/Hz. Rate $R$ then verifies with $m=1$, therefore the expected diversity is $LN-M+1=3$. The outage probability is displayed on Fig. \\[fig:Pout\\] as a function of SNR. We observe a slope of $-10^{-3}$ per decade, hence a diversity of $3$, confirming the result stated in part \\[sec:freqsel\\].\n\n![Outage probability of the MMSE receiver, L=2, K=64, M=N=2[]{data-label=\"fig:Pout\"}](div_40M){width=\"3in\"}\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn this paper we provided rigorous proofs regarding the diversity of the MMSE receiver at fixed rate, in both flat fading and frequency selective MIMO channels. The higher the aimed rate the less diversity is achieved; in particular, for sufficiently low rates, the MMSE receiver achieves full diversity in both MIMO channel cases, hence its great interest. Nonetheless, in frequency selective channels, the diversity bounds are not tight for some specific rates; this could probably be improved. Simulations corroborated our results.\n\n {#apx:prob_sum_first_ev}\n\nWe prove in this appendix that, for $b>0$, $\\PP(\\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b) \\ \\dot\\geq \\ \\rho^{-m(N-M+m)}$.\n\nWe note $\\mathcal{C}_m$ the set defined by $\\mathcal{C}_m = \\{ \\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m: \\ 0 < \\lambda_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_m, \\ \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\}$. As the $\\lambda_i$ verify $0 < \\lambda_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M$, we can write $$\\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\Bigg)\n  = \\int_{(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m) \\in \\mathcal{C}_m} \\int_{\\lambda_m}^{+\\infty} \\bhs\\ldots \\int_{\\lambda_{M-1}}^{+\\infty} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M,\n  \\label{eq:prob_sum_first_ev}$$ where $p_{M,N}: \\mathbb{R}^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the joint probability density function of the ordered eigenvalues of a $M \\times M$ Wishart matrix with scale matrix $\\I_M$ and $N$ degrees of freedom, given by (see, e.g., [@zheng2003diversity]): $$p_{M,N} = K_{M,N}^{-1} \\prod_{i=1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2,\n  \\label{eq:p-wish}$$ where $K_{M,N}$ is a normalizing constant. We now try to separate the integral in in two integrals, one over $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m$, the other over $\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M$. As we have $(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_m) \\in \\mathcal{C}_m$ in , $\\lambda_m < b / \\rho$ and thus $$\\begin{split}\n      \\int_{\\lambda_m \\leq \\lambda_{m+1} \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M} & p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n      \\\\\n      & \\geq \\int_{(\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{D}} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n  \\end{split}\n  \\label{ineq:2intg}$$ where $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^{M-m}; \\ b/\\rho \\leq \\lambda_{m+1}\\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M \\}$. This integral can be simplified by noticing that $p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M)$ explicit expression is invariant by permutation of its parameters $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M$, in particular by permutation of its parameters $\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M$. Therefore, noting $\\mathcal{S}=\\mathrm{Sym}(\\{\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M\\})$ the group of permutations over the finite set $\\{\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M\\}$, we get $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\bhs\\ldots \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} & p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M \\notag\n    \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\int_{s(\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{D}} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M \\notag\n    \\\\\n    & = \\mathrm{Card}(\\mathcal{S}) \\int_{ (\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{D}} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M \\notag\n    \\\\\n    & = (M-m)! \\int_{ (\\lambda_{m+1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{D}} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M.\n    \\label{eq:intg-symm}\\end{aligned}$$ Using and in , we obtain $$\\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\Bigg)\n  \\geq \\frac{1}{(M-m)!} \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_m} \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\bhs\\ldots \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M.$$ We now replace $p_{M,N}$ by its explicit expression and then try to separate the $m$ first eigenvalues from the others. Note that we can drop the constants $(M-m)!$ and $K_{M,N}$ as we only need an asymptotic lower bound. $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\mhs \\Bigg) \\mhs\n \\ \\dot\\geq & \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_m} \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\prod_{i=1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\,\n d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n \\\\\n = & \\ \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_m} \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty}\n \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\, \\Bigg)\n \\\\\n & \\cdot \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=m+1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i\\leq m<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\prod_{m<i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\,  \\Bigg)\n \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n \\end{aligned}$$ For $i\\leq m<j$, we have that $\\lambda_i \\leq b/\\rho$ and thus $(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\geq \\big(\\lambda_j-\\frac{b}{\\rho}\\big)^2$. Hence, $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\mhs \\Bigg)\n  \\dot\\geq & \\  \\bigg( \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_m} \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\   d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_m \\bigg)\n  \\label{eq:2sep-intg}\n  \\\\\n  & \\cdot \\mhs \\bigg( \\mhs \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \\bhs\\mhs\\mhs \\ldots \\int_{b/\\rho}^{+\\infty} \n  \\mhs\\mhs \\prod_{i=m+1}^M  \\mhs\\mhs\\mhs \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M}e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right)\n  \\mhs \\prod_{j=m+1}^M \\mhs\\mhs\\mhs \\left(\\lambda_j-\\frac{b}{\\rho}\\right)^{\\,\\mhs\\mhs 2m}\n  \\mhs\\mhs \\prod_{m<i<j} \\mhs\\mhs\\mhs (\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2  \\  d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M \\mhs\\mhs\\bigg) \\notag\n \\end{aligned}$$ We now have two separate integrals.

It is straightforward to see that the integral in is nonzero, finite, independent from $\\rho$ and therefore asymptotically equivalent to $1$ in the sense of . Hence, we can drop the second integral in , leading to: $$\\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\mhs \\Bigg)\n    \\dot\\geq \\  \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_m} \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\   d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_m.\n    \\label{ineq:only1-intg}$$ Making the substitution $\\alpha_i= \\rho \\lambda_i$ for $i=1, \\ldots, m$ in and noting $\\mathcal{C}'_m=\\{ \\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_m: \\ 0 < \\alpha_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\alpha_m, \\ \\sum_{k=1}^m \\alpha_k < b \\}$ we then have $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP \\Bigg(\\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\Bigg)\n  & \\, \\dot\\geq \\, \\bigg( \\rho^{-m-m(N-M)-m(m-1)} \\int_{\\mathcal{C}'_m} \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\alpha_i^{N-M} e^{-\\alpha_i/\\rho}  \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)^2  \\  d\\alpha_1 \\ldots  d\\alpha_m \\bigg) \\notag\n  \\\\\n  & \\geq \\rho^{-m(N-M+m)} \\int_{\\mathcal{C}'_m} \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\alpha_i^{N-M} e^{-\\alpha_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)^2  \\   d\\alpha_1 \\ldots d\\alpha_m\n  \\label{ineq:no-intg}\n \\end{aligned}$$ for $\\rho \\geq 1$, as we have then $e^{- \\alpha_i/\\rho} \\geq e^{- \\alpha_i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, m$. As $b>0$ it is straightforward to see that the integral in is nonzero but also finite and independent from $\\rho$; it is therefore asymptotically equivalent to $1$ in the sense of , yielding $$\\PP \\Bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^m \\rho \\lambda_k < b \\Bigg) \\dot\\geq \\ \\rho^{-m(N-M+m)},$$ which concludes the proof.\n\n {#apx:prob_first_ev_bounded}\n\nWe prove in this section that $\\PP\\left( \\mathcal{B}_1 \\right) \\dot\\leq \\, \\rho^{-m(M-N+m)}$, where the set $\\mathcal{B}_1$ is defined by $$\\mathcal{B}_1= \\{ \\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_M, \\, 0 < \\lambda_k \\leq b, \\, k=1,\\ldots,m \\},$$ with $b>0$ and $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M$ the ordered eigenvalues of the Wishart matrix $\\H^*\\H$. We use the same approach as in Appendix \\[apx:prob\\_sum\\_first\\_ev\\]. For we note $p_{M,N}$ the joint probability density function of the ordered eigenvalues of a $M \\times M$ Wishart matrix with scale matrix $\\I_M$ and $N$ degrees of freedom, the probability $\\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)$ can be written as $$\\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)\n   = \\int_{(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{B}_1}\n   p_{M,N}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M.$$ Similarly to Appendix \\[apx:prob\\_sum\\_first\\_ev\\] we try to upper bound $\\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)$ by the product of two integrals, one containing the $m$ first eigenvalues and the other the $M-m$ remaining eigenvalues. We first replace $p_{M,N}$ by it explicit expression : $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)\n  & = K_{M,N}^{-1} \\int_{(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{B}_1}\n   \\prod_{i=1}^M \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\prod_{i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n   \\\\\n  & \\doteq \\int_{(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_M) \\in \\mathcal{B}_1}\n   \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\Bigg)\n   \\\\\n  & \\fhs \\cdot \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=m+1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i\\leq m<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\prod_{m<i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2  \\Bigg)\n  \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M.\n \\end{aligned}$$ Note that we dropped the normalizing constant $K_{M,N}$, as $K_{M,N}^{-1} \\doteq 1$. For $i \\leq m < j$, we have $|\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j| \\leq \\lambda_j$ and thus $\\prod_{i\\leq m<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\leq \\prod_{j=m+1}^M \\lambda_j^{2m}$, yielding $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)\n  & \\,\\dot\\leq\\,\n    \\int_0^{b/\\rho} \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{b/\\rho} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{\\lambda_{m-1}}^{b/\\rho} \\int_{\\lambda_m}^{+\\infty} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{\\lambda_{M-1}}^{+\\infty}\n    \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2 \\Bigg)\n    \\\\\n  & \\fhs \\cdot  \\Bigg( \\prod_{i=m+1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N+2m-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{m<i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2  \\Bigg)\n    \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_M\n \\end{aligned}$$ In order to obtain two separate integrals we discard the $\\lambda_m$ in the integral bound simply by noticing that $\\lambda_m>0$, therefore $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1)\n  & \\,\\dot\\leq\\,\n    \\Bigg( \\int_0^{b/\\rho} \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{b/\\rho} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{\\lambda_{m-1}}^{b/\\rho}\n    \\prod_{i=1}^m \\left( \\lambda_i^{N-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{i<j\\leq m}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2\n    \\ d\\lambda_1 \\ldots d\\lambda_m \\Bigg)\n    \\\\\n  & \\fhs \\cdot \\Bigg( \\int_0^{+\\infty} \\int_{\\lambda_{m+1}}^{+\\infty} \\bhs \\ldots \\int_{\\lambda_{M-1}}^{+\\infty}\n    \\prod_{i=m+1}^M \\left( \\lambda_i^{N+2m-M} e^{-\\lambda_i} \\right) \\prod_{m<i<j}(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)^2\n    \\ d\\lambda_{m+1} \\ldots d\\lambda_M \\Bigg)\n \\end{aligned}$$ As the second integral (in $\\lambda_{m+1}$, …, $\\lambda_M$) is nonzero, finite and independent of $\\rho$ it is asymptotically equivalent to $1$ in the sense of .

The remaining integral in is nonzero ($b > 0$), finite and does not depend on $\\rho$; therefore, is asymptotically equivalent to $\\rho^{-m(N-M+m)}$ in the sense of . Coming back to we obtain $$\\PP(\\mathcal{B}_1) \\ \\dot\\leq \\ \\rho^{-m(N-M+m)}.$$\n\n {#apx:ang_par}\n\nIn this appendix, we review the results of [@dita2003factorization; @lundberg2004haar] for the reader’s convenience.\n\nIt has been shown in [@dita2003factorization] that any $n \\times n$ unitary matrix $A_n$ can be written as $$A_n = d_n {\\mathcal{O}}_n \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & A_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix},\n  \\label{eq:unitary_dec}$$ with $A_{n-1}$ a $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ unitary matrix, $d_n$ a diagonal phases matrix, that is $d_n = \\mathrm{diag}(e^{i\\varphi_1}, \\ldots, e^{i\\varphi_n})$ with $\\varphi_1, \\ldots, \\varphi_n \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, and $\\mathcal{O}_n$ an orthogonal matrix (the angles matrix). Matrix $\\mathcal{O}_n$ can be written in terms of parameters $\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_n \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ thanks to the following decomposition: $\\mathcal{O}_n = J_{n-1,n} J_{n-2,n-1} \\ldots J_{1,2}$, where $$J_{i,i+1}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\I_{i-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta_i & -\\sin\\theta_i & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta_i & -\\sin\\theta_i & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\I_{n-i-1} \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nLet $\\U_M$ be a $M \\times M$ unitary Haar distributed matrix. Then, using decomposition , $$\\U_M= \\D_M({\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1) \\V_M({\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1) \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\U_{M-1} \\end{bmatrix},$$ with ${\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1=(\\varphi_{1,1},\\ldots,\\varphi_{1,M}) \\in [0,2\\pi]^M$, ${\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1=(\\theta_{1,1},\\ldots,\\theta_{1,M-1}) \\in [0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]^{M-1}$, $\\D_M({\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1)$ the diagonal matrix defined by $\\D_M({\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1)=\\mathrm{diag}(e^{i\\varphi_{1,1}},\\ldots,e^{i\\varphi_{1,M}})$, $\\V_M({\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1)$ the orthogonal matrix defined by $\\V_M({\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1)=J_{M-1,M} J_{M-2,M-1} \\ldots J_{1,2}$ and $\\U_M$ a $M-1 \\times M-1$ unitary matrix. Matrix $\\U_{M-1}$ can naturally be similarly factorized.\n\nSimilarly to [@lundberg2004haar], we can show that, in order $\\U_M$ to be a Haar matrix it is sufficient that $(\\varphi_{1,i})_{i=1,\\ldots,M}$ are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over interval $[0, 2\\pi[$, that $\\theta_{1,1},\\ldots,\\theta_{1,M-1}$ are independent with densities respectively equal to $(\\sin \\theta_1)^{M-2}, (\\sin \\theta_2)^{M-3}, \\ldots, (\\sin \\theta_{M-2}), 1$ and independent from ${\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1$ and that $\\U_{M-1}$ is Haar distributed and independent from ${\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1$ and ${\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1$. The proof consists in first showing, by a simple variable change, that if the $(\\varphi_{1,i})_{i=1,\\ldots,M}$ and the $\\theta_{1,1},\\ldots,\\theta_{1,M-1}$ follow the mentioned distributions then $\\D_M({\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1) \\V_M({\\boldsymbol}\\theta_1)$ is uniformly distributed over the unity sphere of $\\mathbb{C}^M$. The proof is then completed by showing that if $\\U_{M-1}$ is a Haar matrix independent from ${\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1$ and $\\theta_1$ then $\\U_M$ is Haar distributed.\n\nFinally one can parameterize a Haar matrix $\\U_M$ by ${\\boldsymbol}\\varphi_1$, $\\theta_1$ and $\\U_{M-1}$. Repeating the same parametrization for $\\U_{M-1}$ we obtain that $\\U_M$ can be parameterized by the $M^2$ following independent variables $$\\begin{aligned}\n  &(\\varphi_{1,1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{1,M}), (\\theta_{1,1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{1,M-1}), (\\varphi_{2,1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{2,M-1}), (\\theta_{2,1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{2,M-2}), \\ldots,\n  \\\\\n  &(\\varphi_{M-2,1}, \\varphi_{M-2,2}), \\theta_{M-2,1}, \\varphi_{M-1,1},\n \\end{aligned}$$ whose probability laws are almost surely positive.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

A total of 11 secondary HPS patients examined with 18F-FDG-PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnostic value of F-18 FDG PET/CT for malignancy detection was assessed. The values of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) in spleen (SUVS(p)) and in bone marrow (SUVBM) were measured to analyze their relationship with various laboratorial parameters and clinical outcome of secondary HPS patients. The results showed that 4 out of the 11 patients had malignancies, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT for malignancy detection were 100%, 66.7% and 75% respectively, the SUV(max) of spleen and bone marrow showed no significant correlation with laboratorial parameters, a maximum SUVS(p) of 3.10 and a maximum SUVBM of 3.47 were the optimal cutoffs for predicting patients' outcome, the increased uptake of F-18 FDG in the BM and spleen were significantly associated with shorter survival time according to univariate analysis. It is concluded that 18F-FDG PET/CT may especially play an important role in diagnosis and predicting outcome of secondary HPS for the small sample size.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The fate of cranial neural crest cells in the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri.\nThe cranial neural crest has been shown to give rise to a diversity of cells and tissues, including cartilage, bone and connective tissue, in a variety of tetrapods and in the zebrafish. It has been claimed, however, that in the Australian lungfish these tissues are not derived from the cranial neural crest, and even that no migrating cranial neural crest cells exist in this species. We have earlier documented that cranial neural crest cells do migrate, although they emerge late, in the Australian lungfish. Here, we have used the lipophilic fluorescent dye, DiI, to label premigratory cranial neural crest cells and follow their fate until stage 43, when several cranial skeletal elements have started to differentiate. The timing and extent of their migration was investigated, and formation of mandibular, hyoid and branchial streams documented. Cranial neural crest was shown to contribute cells to several parts of the head skeleton, including the trabecula cranii and derivatives of the mandibular arch (e.g., Meckel's cartilage, quadrate), the hyoid arch (e.g., the ceratohyal) and the branchial arches (ceratobranchials I-IV), as well as to the connective tissue surrounding the myofibers in cranial muscles.

Robein, Jr., Metairie, for the Office of the State Examiner of the Municipal Fire and Police Civil Service.\nBefore CARAWAY, MOORE and LOLLEY, JJ.\nCARAWAY, J.\nThis suit concerns a civil service claim for denial of procedural due process by a terminated fireman against his employer, a Louisiana fire protection district. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the fire protection district and dismissed it from the suit on the grounds that the fireman was not entitled to the protections of the Louisiana civil service law. Finding that plaintiff is a civil service employee, we reverse the summary judgment in favor of the fire protection district, grant the fireman's partial summary judgment declaring the application of the civil service system of La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., to the defendant fire protection district, and remand to the district court.\n\nFacts\nOn August 16, 2006, Todd France was employed as a full-time, salaried senior fireman with the East Central Bossier Parish Fire Protection District No 1 (hereinafter the FPD), when he was involved in an on-duty traffic accident. France was notified by memorandum on August 17, 2006, that as a result of the incident he was suspended without pay for the remainder of his August 17, 2006 shift plus two additional shifts pending the results of post-accident drug testing. He was also notified that he could appeal the discipline within 15 days to the Board of Commissioners for the district. The FPD is a special district created by the legislature pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1491, et seq., governed by a Board of Commissioners appointed by the Bossier Parish Police Jury. The FPD has four, full-time fire service employees and 60-80 volunteers and by action of the Board of Commissioners of the FPD, opted out of participation in Louisiana's civil service law set forth in La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq.\nOn August 30, 2006, France received a second memorandum which terminated his *962 employment due to the presence of a prescription drug in his system which impaired his judgment at the time of the accident. France was again informed of his right to appeal the termination in writing to the Board of Commissioners within 15 days. France did not appeal either action. On August 15, 2007, he instituted suit against the FPD and other defendants raising in relevant part claims of violation of his procedural due process rights under the state civil service law. He asserted that he should have received a civil service employee classification, a protected property right in Louisiana. France claimed that his rights to appeal the termination to a civil service board, a disciplinary hearing and post-disciplinary review were denied due to the FPD's failure to follow the Louisiana civil service law. France prayed for reinstatement of his employment and back pay.\nThe FPD filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the claim. The FPD argued that it is not required to submit to the civil service-mandated procedures because it is primarily a volunteer fire department. In support of the motion for summary judgment, the FPD attached the affidavit of the assistant fire chief, which attested to the fact that the FPD had four, full-time employees and 60-80 volunteers. In response, France also moved for partial summary judgment for the declaration that employees paid by the FPD are protected by the civil service law. The central issue raised by both parties concerned the application and meaning of Article X, § 16 of the Louisiana Constitution which addresses a civil service system for \"fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department.\"\nA hearing on the summary judgment motions occurred on June 30, 2008. Both sides orally argued their positions and the trial court ruled in favor of the FPD, finding that it was not subject to the Louisiana civil service law. France's procedural due process action was dismissed. This appeal by France ensued.\n\nCivil Service Law\nPrior to 1940, the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 contained a limited provision concerning civil service for municipalities with populations over 100,000. La. Const.1921, art. XIV, § 15. The first wide-ranging civil service law in Louisiana resulted from Act Nos. 171 and 172 and the amendment of Article XIV, § 15 of the former constitution in 1940. This law related to state and city employees but excluded fire and police personnel.\nShortly after the enactment of the 1940 legislation, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected various claims that the statutory law relating to state and city civil service improperly transcended the Louisiana constitutional provisions for civil service. Ricks v. Dep't of State Civil Serv., 200 La. 341, 8 So.2d 49 (1942). The 1940 amendment to the constitution had specifically \"ratified, approved and affirmed\" the two earlier acts of the legislature in 1940 creating the state and city civil service systems. Nevertheless, the court recognized such constitutional affirmation of the legislation was unnecessary, reasoning that it was \"not necessary to amend the Constitution to authorize the Legislature to enact the State Civil Service Law, for the reason that our Constitution contains no restriction in this respect.\" Id. at 65.\nA similar ruling by our Supreme Court in 1954 addressed the effect of other changes in the constitution regarding the civil service system for New Orleans. Gervais v. New Orleans Police Dep't, 226 La. 782, 77 So.2d 393 (1954). The employee sought reversal of the ruling of the Civil Service Commission of the City of New Orleans arguing that he was not covered by civil service law because the constitutional *963 amendment was penal in nature and should not be applied retrospectively to him. The Louisiana Supreme Court again rejected such argument, holding that it \"matter[ed] not that the [employee's] acts upon which dismissal was founded occurred prior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment,\" because the amendment \"did not repeal or supersede\" statutory law which was in place at the time of the amendment and applied to the employee. Regarding civil service rights, the court also noted that the \"legislative authority which created the right can take it away or change, at any time, the procedure by which it may be protected or defended, save as otherwise curtailed by the civil service provisions of the Constitution.\"\nThe history of the civil service law relating to fire and police departments began shortly after the 1940 legislation. 1944 La. Acts 102, see now La. R.S. 33:2471, et seq., first established the System of Classified Civil Service with respect to Municipal Fire and Police Services in municipalities with populations of 13,000 to 250,000 (hereinafter the Larger Municipalities) \"which shall operate and maintain a regularly paid fire and police department.\" In connection with civil service law, this was the first legislative use of the phrase \"regularly paid fire ... department.\" Nevertheless, its use related only to municipalities since fire protection districts were not addressed in the legislation. The Act provided that the Classified Civil Service \"embrac[ed] the positions of employment ... of the Municipal Fire and Police Services.\"\n1952 La. Acts 302, adopted on November 4, 1952, added § 15.1, The Municipal Fire and Police Civil Service Law, to Article XIV of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 and generally tracked the language of 1944 La. Acts 102, for a civil service system for the Larger Municipalities. Again, § 15.1 was made applicable to a large municipality \"which operates a regularly paid fire and police department.\" The classified civil service \"embrac[ed] the positions of employment ... of the municipal fire and police services.\"\nA review of the history of Louisiana legislation dealing with fire protection districts shows that fire protection districts were first authorized by the legislature in 1942 La. Acts 194, § 1, which is the source for the present statutes, La. R.S. 40:1492, et seq. Generally, these provisions give parish governing authorities the power to create or enlarge fire protection districts and provide that fire protection districts are subdivisions of the state. La. R.S. 40:1492. If no municipal corporation is included within the boundaries of a district comprising all or part of a single parish, the parish governing authority may appoint a board of commissioners to serve as the governing body for the district. La. R.S. 40:1495. Nothing in this legislation in Title 40 defines or characterizes a \"fire protection district\" in terms of a \"department\" with \"regularly paid\" employees.\n1964 La. Acts 282, now La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., enacted the Fire and Police Civil Service Law for Small Municipalities and for Parishes and Fire Protection Districts. The initial provision, La. R.S. 33:2531, expresses in its title, \"mandatory civil service\" for fire protection districts and the language of the statute mandates application of a general system of civil service protection for the \"permanent appointments and promotions for paid firemen.\" These provisions created \"in the government of each fire protection district, a classified civil service embracing the positions of employment,\" for fire and police services in the smaller municipalities, parishes, and fire protection districts. La. R.S. 33:2535. The law delineates the classified and unclassified service of employees *964 in La. R.S. 33:2541. Appeals to a civil service board are also authorized under the statutes. La. R.S. 33:2561. Relevant to the effect of other laws, the fire and police civil service law for fire protection districts provides that \"this part shall not be rendered ineffective by any general law affecting employees or departments of municipalities, parishes or fire protection districts in matters of classified civil service.\" La. R.S. 33:2568.\nRevising the prior constitution's fire and police civil service provision for the Larger Municipalities, the 1974 Constitution of Louisiana maintained abbreviated provisions for the civil service law in La. Const. 1974, art. X, § 16 as follows:\nA system of classified fire and police civil service is created and established. It shall apply to all municipalities having a population exceeding thirteen thousand and operating a regularly paid fire and municipal police department and to all parishes and fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department.\nNotably, in addition to the prior constitutional protection carried forward for the Larger Municipalities by this section, the provision also constitutionally mandated for the first time a civil service system for \"fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department.\"\nLa. Const.1974, art. X, § 18 also provides as follows in relevant part:\nExcept as inconsistent with this Part, the provisions of Article XIV, Section 15.1 of the Constitution of 1921 are retained and continued in force and effect as statutes. By law enacted by two-thirds of the elected members of each house, the legislature may amend or otherwise modify any of these provisions, but it may not abolish the system of classified civil service for such firemen and municipal policemen or make the system inapplicable to ... any fire protection district operating a regularly paid fire department.\nThe statutory reference of this provision related only to the existing civil service laws for Larger Municipalities, and as directed, remains in La. R.S. 33:2471, et seq.\n\nDiscussion\nThe parties' motions for summary judgment recognize that the facts concerning the fire employees and volunteers who perform the firefighting services of the FPD are not disputed. This leaves for decision only the legal issue appropriate for these summary judgment proceedings regarding whether France, as an employee of a fire protection district with a large amount of volunteer firemen, is afforded the protection of the civil service law. The parties address and argue the application of both the statutory basis for a civil service system for fire protection districts under La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., and the constitutional basis for a civil service system under Article X, § 16. Each law purports to \"create\" a system. Accordingly, we must review the meaning and scope of the legislative and constitutional enactments to determine whether a conflict exists between the two. We can then answer the FPD's contention that the constitution's creation and directive for a system of classified fire civil service for \"fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department\" means that the FPD's primarily volunteer department is outside the coverage of civil service law.\nThe historical development of our civil service laws shows that the first time that civil service was addressed in the context of a fire protection district was in 1964 with the legislative enactment of La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq. (hereinafter the \"1964 Legislation\") which remains virtually the same law today. At that time, no Louisiana *965 constitutional provision specifically addressed civil service for fire protection districts. Likewise, the constitution in 1964 contained no prohibition regarding the legislative application of a civil service system to fire protection districts. The 1964 Legislation defines a \"position\" as \"any office or employment in the ... fire protection district, fire ... service, the duties of which call for services to be rendered by one person.\" La. R.S. 33:2533(13). A \"`regular employee' or `permanent employee' means an employee who has been appointed to a position of classified service.\" La. R.S. 33:2533(18). The distinction between classified and unclassified service positions addressed in La. R.S. 33:2541 demonstrates that France's fire fighting and prevention duties would place him in the classified service.\nThis review of the 1964 Legislation reveals no distinction between fire protection districts composed entirely of paid personnel and those with a combination of paid personnel and unpaid volunteer firefighters. From our reading of La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., every fire protection district falls under the legislation and is mandated to conduct the procedures of the statutory civil service system for classified service positions of employment.[1] There is no language in the 1964 Legislation, La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., containing the phrase \"fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department\" so as to make any distinction regarding the application of the law to any fire protection districts which might be construed as operating something different from a regularly paid fire department.\nTurning to Article X, § 16 of the 1974 Constitution, we will consider its directives to determine whether it conflicts with the existing 1964 Legislation. We first note that there is a clear distinction between the new constitutional provision and the 1964 Legislation concerning the size of the municipalities addressed by each. Article X, § 16 addresses civil service for the Larger Municipalities over thirteen thousand in population while the 1964 Legislation addresses municipalities between 7,000 and 13,000 in population. In fact, the first sentence of Article X, § 16 which states that \"a system of classified fire and police civil service is created and established\" is an acknowledgment of the existing law before 1974 for fire and police civil service for the Larger Municipalities under La. R.S. 33:2471, et seq., and Article XIV, § 15.1 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921. Additionally, the new Article X, § 18 also insured that the existing fire and police civil service for the Larger Municipalities continued with constitutional protection. Nevertheless, there was nothing included in Article X, § 16 regarding the small municipalities, and the 1964 Legislation continued and remains today as the only source of law for civil service for such towns. La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq.\nThe addition to Article X, §§ 16 and 18 addressing \"any fire protection district operating a regularly paid fire department\" represents the first Louisiana constitutional provisions ever addressing civil service for any fire protection district. The effect *966 of Article X, § 16 is to mandate that a system of classified civil service shall apply to such fire districts, and in Article X, § 18, the legislature is prevented from abolishing civil service for such districts. There is nothing in these two sections of our existing constitution that prohibits a legislative act from creating a civil service system for those fire protection districts which might be viewed as falling outside the particular fire protection districts addressed in these constitutional provisions. Just as Article X, § 16's provisions addressing the Larger Municipalities do not preclude by implication the legislature's power to provide civil service protection to the employees of the smaller municipalities, the Article does not prevent such power of the legislature to provide civil service protection for the employees of any fire protection district, which might be determined as a district lacking a regularly paid fire department.\nThe authority for this construction of the constitution in relation to the 1964 Legislation is provided in the Ricks and Gervais rulings above which stand for the proposition that the general plenary power of the legislature alone, without any specific constitutional provision dealing with civil service, is ample authority to legislate a system of civil service in this state. The legislative power of the state of Louisiana is vested in the Legislature. La. Const.1974, art. III, § 1. Except as expressly provided by the constitution, no other branch of government, nor any persons holding office in one of them, may exercise the legislative power. La. Const. 1974, art. II, §§ 1, 2. Furthermore, it is a general principle of judicial interpretation that, unlike the federal constitution, a state constitution's provisions are not grants of power but instead are limitations on the otherwise plenary power of the people of a state exercised through its Legislature. In its exercise of the entire legislative power of the state, the Legislature may enact any legislation that the state constitution does not prohibit. Thus, to hold legislation invalid under the constitution, it is necessary to rely on some particular constitutional provision that limits the power of the Legislature to enact such a statute. Board of Dir., Louisiana Recovery Dist. v. All Taxpayers, Property Owners, and Citizens of La., 529 So.2d 384 (La.1988); Board of Comm'rs v. Dept. of Natural Resources, 496 So.2d 281 (La. 1986); New Orleans Firefighters Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New Orleans, 422 So.2d 402, 406 (La.1982); State ex rel. Guste v. Legislative Budget Comm., 347 So.2d 160, 164 (La.1977); see also, State v. Mallery, 364 So.2d 1283 (La.1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 940, 99 S.Ct. 2881, 61 L.Ed.2d 310 (1979) (\"Except as limited by the constitution its power is plenary\"); Swift v. State, 342 So.2d 191 (La.1977) (\"Unlike Congress, our State Legislature has all powers of legislation not specifically denied it by the Louisiana Constitution\").\nUnless the fundamental rights, privileges and immunities of a person are involved, there is a strong presumption that the Legislature in adopting a statute has acted within its constitutional powers. Board of Dir., Louisiana Recovery Dist., supra, and cased cited therein. The presumption is especially forceful in the case of statutes enacted to promote a public purpose, such as statutes relating to taxation and public finance. Id. The party attacking such a statute has the burden of showing clearly that the legislation is invalid or unconstitutional, and any doubt as to the legislation's constitutionality must be resolved in its favor. Id. In an attack upon a legislative act as falling within an exception to the Legislature's otherwise plenary power, it is not enough to show that the constitutionality is fairly debatable, but, rather, it must be shown clearly and convincingly that it was the constitutional *967 aim to deny the Legislature the power to enact the statute. Id.\nCivil Code Article 8 provides that the repeal of a law \"is implied when the new law contains provisions that are contrary to, or irreconcilable with, those of the former law.\" While repeals by implication are not favored, a constitutional amendment or provision operates to supersede or repeal all statutes that are inconsistent with the full operation of its provisions. Macon v. Costa, 437 So.2d 806, 810 (La. 1983). A special law can be repealed by a subsequent general law only when the two cannot stand together. Id., note 3 citing McManemin v. Bossier Parish Police Jury, 228 So.2d 36 (La.App. 2d Cir. 1969), writ denied, 255 La. 240, 230 So.2d 91 (1970).\nUnderlying FPD's position in this dispute is the contention that in 1974, the new Article X, § 16 constitutionally limited the application of a classified civil service to a subset of all fire protection districts, i.e., those \"fire protection districts operating a regularly paid fire department.\" FPD denies that it is such a fire protection district, claiming that its four employees do not amount to a \"regularly paid fire department.\" Nevertheless, we find this argument irrelevant to the issue at hand which concerns only the continued effect of the 1964 Legislation which was applicable to all fire protection districts before 1974 and remains unrepealed by the Legislature today. Even if Article X, § 16 extends constitutional protection to a small subset of fire protection districts, the Article makes no express prohibition barring the general plenary power of the Legislature to enact civil service laws for all other fire protection districts. Likewise, if the purpose of Article X, § 16 was to provide constitutional protection to only a subset of all fire protection districts, such purpose was not inconsistent or irreconcilable with the legislative purpose of La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., which had previously established civil service for all fire protection districts.[2]\n\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiff's claim is reversed. Judgment on France's motion for partial summary judgment is granted, declaring that the civil service system of La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., shall apply to the East Central Bossier Fire Protection District No. 1 and for the defendant's action for dismissal of the employment of the plaintiff. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this ruling. Costs of appeal are assessed to the FPD in the amount of $145.50 in accordance with La. R.S. 13:5112.\nREVERSED. PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT GRANTED. REMANDED.\nNOTES\n[1]  In reaching this conclusion, we reject FPD's argument that La. R.S. 33:2536(N) implies \"that fire or police service in a municipality, parish or fire protection district may not be subject to civil service\" regulation under La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq. Because a fire protection district may include a municipality located within the district (La. R.S. 40:1492(B)), a fire protection district may include both police and fire personnel requiring the appointment of a five-member civil service board under La. R.S. 33:2536(C), or otherwise, where fire services only are provided within the fire protection district, the three member board of La. R.S. 33:2536(N) would appear to apply.\n[2]  No specific argument or alternative argument was made by FPD that La. R.S. 33:2531, et seq., was implicitly repealed or made unconstitutional by the 1974 Constitution, Article X, § 16 insofar as the statutes apply to all fire protection districts in Louisiana. The long-standing jurisprudential rule of law is that a statute cannot first be questioned in the appellate courts and must be specially pleaded and the grounds of the claim particularized. Vallo v. Gayle Oil Co., 94-1238 (La. 11/30/94), 646 So.2d 859. Nevertheless, since the implication of this ruling extends beyond FPD's dispute with France requiring the formation of a civil service board for FPD, we determine that the 1964 Legislation was not implicitly repealed or made unconstitutional by the 1974 Constitution and that FPD, regardless of whether it operates a regularly paid fire department or not, must follow the legislative mandate.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

It is crucial to deliver the acoustic power within tolerance limits for effective liver tumour treatment via MRgFUS. Before application in a clinical setting, evidence of reproducibility and reliability is a must for safe practice. The TTS software delivers the acoustic power via ExAblate-2100 Conformal Bone System (CBS) transducer. A built-in quality assurance application was developed to measure the force values, using a novel protocol to measure the efficiency for the electrical power values of 100 and 150W for 6s of sonication. This procedure was repeated 30 times by two independent users against the clinically approved ExAblate-2100 CBS for cross-validation. Both systems proved to deliver the power within the accepted efficiency levels (70-90%). Two sample t-tests were used to assess the differences in force values between the ExAblate-2100 CBS and the TTS (p > 0.05). Bland-Altman plots were used to demonstrate the limits of agreement between the two systems falling within the 10% limits of agreement. Two sample t-tests indicated that TTS does not have user dependency (p > 0.05). The TTS software proved to deliver the acoustic power without exceeding the safety levels. Results provide evidence as a part of ISO13485 regulations for CE marking purposes.

{"text": "Antioxidant modulation in response to metal-induced oxidative stress in algal chloroplasts.\nTo investigate adaptive responses to metal stress at the subcellular level, the oxidative balance in isolated chloroplasts was evaluated for the first time in the unicellular alga Gonyaulax polyedra exposed to the toxic metals Hg(2+), Cd(2+), Pb(2+), and Cu(2+). Different antioxidant responses were verified according to the metal and model of stress applied. Cells chronically exposed to metals exhibited high activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase, high glutathione content, and decrease of peridinin levels, whereas no significant changes were detected for beta-carotene levels. In contrast, cells subjected to acute metal stress displayed twice as much beta-carotene but only a slight increase in superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities. The correlation of acute metal treatment and oxidative stress was inferred from the higher oxygen uptake and decreased reduced glutathione pool found in treated cells. In addition, increased oxidative damage to proteins and lipids occurred mainly in cells under acute stress. Pb(2+) was the most damaging toxicant, causing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation even at chronic treatment. These results indicate that heavy metals are able to induce oxidative stress in chloroplasts of G. polyedra, particularly under acute conditions. Nevertheless, the maintenance of a high antioxidant capacity within chloroplasts seems to be an important strategy during acclimation of G. polyedra to chronic metal stress. By acting at the subcellular site, where oxidative stress is triggered, induction of such chloroplast antioxidants might be crucial for cell survival during exposure to heavy metals.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Internet commerce, or e-commerce as it is otherwise known, relates to the buying and selling of products and services between consumers and merchants over the Internet or other like transactional exchanges of information. The convenience of shopping over the Internet has sparked considerable interest in e-commerce on behalf of both consumers and merchants. Internet sales, or like transactions, have been typically carried out using standard credit cards such as Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, or the like, or standard debit cards, i.e., check cards or automated teller machine (ATM) cards which directly access funds from an associated deposit account or other bank account.\nWhile widely used for more traditional face-to-face transactions, use of these standard cards in connection with e-commerce presents certain difficulties, including difficulties concerning authentication or positive identification of the cardholder. For example, maintaining consumer confidence in security has become difficult with increased reports of fraud. The resulting apprehension is also fueled by consumer uncertainty of the reputation or integrity of a merchant with whom the consumer is dealing. Questionable security of the consumer's card information or other personal information typically submitted along with a traditional e-commerce transaction (e.g., address, card number, phone number, etc.) serves to increase apprehension even more. Additionally, cardholders, merchants and financial institutions are all concerned about safeguarding against fraudulent or otherwise unauthorized transactions.\nAccordingly, various credit card networks have implemented initiatives or programs aimed at safeguarding against fraud. For example, Visa® and MasterCard® both support authentication initiatives whereby a cardholder is authenticated by the bank or financial institution issuing the card, i.e., the issuing bank. FIG. 1, illustrates one such exemplary authentication initiative. As shown in this example, a consumer/cardholder 10, e.g., employing a suitable web browser or the like, is making an on-line purchase, e.g., over the Internet, from a merchant 20. As is known in the art, the illustrated back-end payment processing chain includes an optional payment gateway 30, the merchant's financial institution or acquiring bank 32, the credit card network 34 and the issuing bank 36.\nAt a point of checkout, the consumer 10 selects an appropriate payment method based on the initiatives supported by the merchant 20. At this point, the consumer fills out the on-line checkout form including a payment option, card number, expiration date, etc. Based on the payment information, the merchant 20, via a plug-in 22 installed on their server, passes a verify enrollment request (VEReq) message to a directory 38 on a server, e.g., suitably operated by the credit card network 34. The directory 38 includes a database associating participating merchants with their acquiring banks and a database associating card number ranges with locations or addresses, e.g., universal resource locator (URL) addresses, of issuing banks' authentication servers, e.g., the authentication server 40 for issuing bank 36. The VEReq message is a request to verify the enrollment of the card in the authentication program, and it contains the card number provided by the consumer 10.\nBased on the card number range stored within the directory, the VEReq message will be sent to the appropriate URL address for the server 40 which returns to the merchant 20 via the directory 38 a response thereto, i.e., a verify enrollment response (VERes). That is to say, the server 40 will verify the enrollment status of the card and respond with a VERes message to the directory 38 which is then passed back to the merchant's plug-in component 22.\nBased on the VERes message (i.e., if positive), the merchant plug-in component 22 will redirect the cardholder's browser to the server 40 by passing it a payer authentication request (PAReq) message generated by the merchant's plug-in component 22. The consumer 10 then completes an authentication process directly with the server 40. The authentication server 40 authenticates the consumer/cardholder 10 and responds to the merchant 20 with a payer authentication response (PARes) message including a digital signature. The merchant's plug-in component 22 validates the digital signature of the PARes and extracts the authentication status and other specified data that is to be used by the merchant 20 during the payment authorization process carried out via the back-end payment processing chain. For example, the merchant 20 sends an authorization/sale transaction to their payment gateway 30 along with the data elements received from the PARes. The payment gateway 30 routes the data to the acquiring bank 32 based on the acquirer's specification. The acquiring bank 32 then sends the data via the appropriate credit card network 34 to the issuing bank 36 for settlement.\nWhen using authentication initiatives such as the aforementioned example, the credit card network often ensures participating merchants that fraudulent transactions and other charge backs, as they are known in the art, will not be the merchants' responsibility provided the specified protocols have been followed. However, there are considerable burdens placed upon the merchants to participate in the authentication initiatives. For example, typical installation of the merchant plug-in can be overly burdensome using up resources, i.e., computing power, memory, data storage capacity, etc., the merchant would otherwise prefer to devote to other tasks. Often, the plug-in component can be extremely large and/or cumbersome to implement on the merchant's server. Moreover, for a merchant that participates in a plurality of such authentication programs for multiple credit card networks, the burden can be that much more, i.e., requiring a separate plug-in component for each individual authentication initiative they wish to support, especially considering that each credit card network may have its own particular protocols, data fields that are employed in the respective messages, specific data format requirements, etc.\nFurther, the merchants are responsible for remaining current with initiative protocols that can change periodically. That is to say, as the authentication protocols are updated and/or changed by the respective credit card networks, the merchants are likewise responsible for updating and/or changing their plug-in components to reflect those update and/or changes being mandated by the credit card networks.\nThe present invention contemplates a new and improved system and/or method which overcomes the above-referenced problems and others.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Q:\n\nNaming boolean field that is a verb\n\nIn Java, by convention getter and setter for boolean fields will be isField() and setField(). This works perfectly fine with field names that are adjectives like active, visible, closed, etc.\nBut how do I name a field that has meaning of a verb, like haveChildren? Add “_ing” to the verb (havingChildren), maybe?\nTo clarify, I don't have control of the method names (getter and setter) as they are auto-generated by the IDE. So what I need is an appropriate field name so that when the IDE generate a getter for it, it make senses. For example, hasChildren is a perfect field name, but when the IDE generate the getter for the field it would be isHasChildren. How do I solve this?\n\nA:\n\nShort answer: \n\nmethod names aren't supossed to reflect internal implementation but expected behavior.\n\nLong answer:\nhaveChildren() should be named hasChildren(). \nAlso I don't see hasChildren() as necessarily being the getter for a boolean class member. I guess such a method would find out whether or not a member of type Collection is empty.\nDefault name an IDE gives to generated getters and setters aren't supossed to be a law set in stone.\nAnother point: Interfaces have names for yet-to-be-implemented methods. \nIf method names were supossed to reflect internal implementation, how would someone be able to ever design an interface ? Interfaces don't have an implementation nor they know beforehand what the implementators will do under the hood.\nTake for example the Iterator interface in Java. \nWhen you implement Iterator, even when you have a boolean member named next, you are not supossed to rename hasNext() to isNext() or isHavingNext(). That's an implementation detail. In fact, I've implemented Iterator and what I do is have a member of the type of whathever my class has a list of, named next (not a boolean). hasNext() then returns next!=null.\nAlso, see this:\nclass patient {\n      private boolean hasPulse;\n      private boolean isBreathing:\n      public boolean isDead(){ return (!hasPulse & !isBreathing);}\n}\n\nNote that isDead() is no normal getter.\nTake IDEs' productivity tools for what they are.\n\nA:\n\nI would suggest renaming the field to parent so that the getter will be isParent and setter will be setParent.\nYou can also try childPresent for the variable name and isChildPresent and setChildPresent as the getter and setter.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

A graduate of University of Fort Hare, Sigcau was an early supporter of the Bantu Authorities in Transkei and was rewarded by the South African government when he was appointed chairman of the Transkei Territorial Authority, the parliament before independence.\n\nPolitical career\nBotha Sigcau was a graduate of University of Fort Hare. In 1939, the government gave Botha Sigcau the chieftaincy over his half-brother, Nelson Sigcau, who the Mpondo felt was their rightful heir. Botha Sigcau was favoured by the apartheid government because they could pay him a large salary in exchange for control of the Transkei. When the Transkei was formed in 1976, Botha Sigcau was appointed the first President of Transkei in Eastern Pondoland, South Africa. Kaiser Matanzima was his elected deputy. The area was granted self-governance under the apartheid regime. The area was known as the Republic of Transkei and it was a Bantustan, an area set aside for members of a specific ethnicity. Botha Sigcau was instrumental in writing the constitution of the Transkei.\n\nThere was popular opposition to Botha Sigcau's chieftaincy because he lacked legitimacy according to Pondo custom. Opposition also arose because Sigcau openly supported the Bantu Authorities and the National Party. There was also widespread corruption in the government appointed tribal courts of Eastern Pondoland, which Botha Sigcau ruled over. In 1958, all the Pondoland districts were invited to send representatives to a large gathering called by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development Michel Daniel Christiaan de Wet Nel, and Botha Sigcau.”. In this meeting, both Nel and Sigcau promised to grant Pondo chiefs seats in local government as councillors but, in practice, Sigcau selected councillors from his own friends and supporters.\n\nDissent over Botha Sigcau’s leadership as president and chief came to its height during the 1960s Mpondo Revolt (1950-1962). A popular movement of resistance arose among the people, and although meetings were illegal, they were held just the same and attended by thousands of people, who came on foot and on horseback to chosen spots on the mountains and ridges.  The demands of the people were: the withdrawal of the Bantu Authorities and Bantu Education Acts; representation in the Republic’s parliament; relief from the increased taxes and passes which hampered free movement; and the removal of Paramount Chief Botha Sigcau. The Pondos discovered that news of their meetings was reaching the magistrate. Drastic action was taken against these informers; huts were burnt down, and many of them were forced to flee from the area.\n\nOn June 6, a massacre occurred when people met to discuss their complaints. Two aircraft and a helicopter dropped tear-gas and smoke bombs on the crowd, and police vehicles approached from two directions. Although it was a peaceful gathering, 11 people died and 23 were arrested after the meeting on a charge of ‘fighting’, and of these 19 were convicted and sentenced. It is reported that Sigcau fired the first shot from the helicopter \n\nOn 1 December 1978, Botha Sigcau died of a heart attack in Umtata.\n\nFamily\nSigcau's daughter, Stella Sigcau, was the leader of the Transkei National Independence Party and the first female Prime Minister of Transkei in 1987, Sigcau's son, Nkosi Ntsikayezwe Sigcau, was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, and Mpondombinini Thandizulu Sigcau kaBotha Manzolwandle Jongilizwe Sigcau his other son successed him to the throne of Paramount chief.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Year of birth missing\nCategory:1978 deaths\nCategory:People from the Eastern Cape\nCategory:Xhosa people\nCategory:Presidents of Transkei\nCategory:Heads of state of Transkei\nCategory:Transkei National Independence Party politicians\nCategory:University of Fort Hare alumni", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "1. Introduction {#sec1-ijms-21-05601}\n===============\n\nIn all mammalian species, preimplantation embryo development can be divided into two phases based on its metabolic activity: (1) the period controlled by the mRNAs and proteins accumulated in the oocyte and characterized by low metabolic activity, and (2) the period following activation of the embryonic genome, which shows a dramatic increase in metabolism concomitantly with blastocoel cavity formation and expansion. This change in the metabolic activity of the embryo is also associated with the passage of the embryo from the oviduct to the uterus \\[[@B1-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The knowledge gained for understanding these mechanisms has exerted significant effects on the success rate of in vitro embryo production (IVEP), attributed to the creation of culture media based on metabolic requirements of the embryo and the composition of oviductal and uterine fluids \\[[@B2-ijms-21-05601],[@B3-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In embryo metabolism, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis depends on the rate of glucose, pyruvate, lipids, and amino acid consumption \\[[@B4-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Also, culture media is supplemented with pyruvate and glucose mainly. However, bovine embryos also have glycogen and lipid reserves. The glycogen concentration seems almost negligible and is poorly described in the literature, but lipids (particularly fatty acids) represent the most abundant energy reservoir of bovine embryos. In addition to lipids as a source of energy, which have not been taken into account for the formulation of culture media for in vitro embryo production. Fatty acids are lipid chain biomolecules composed of long-chain hydrocarbons with a terminal carboxyl group, which are found in the cell as energy storage in the form of triacylglycerol (TG) or free fatty acids (FFAs) in the cytoplasm. They can be used as a substrate for the production of phospholipids, and can also serve as an energy source \\[[@B5-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The FFAs are linked to coenzyme A in the outer mitochondrial membrane, before being transported to the matrix by [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine \\[[@B5-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Subsequently, it initiates the process of β-oxidation to Acyl-CoA. The cellular fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets composed mainly of triacylglycerols. The oocytes of several mammalian species contain comparatively high amounts of lipids stored as droplets in the ooplasm \\[[@B5-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Based on oxygen consumption, it has been suggested that there are sufficient lipids to support the metabolic demands for oocyte maturation as the sole source of energy \\[[@B5-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Lipid metabolism regulators added to culture media can influence the expression of lipid metabolism-regulating genes, and thus, can improve the developmental competence and quality of in vitro produced embryos \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\]. [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine is intrinsically involved in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism via the transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria and its involvement in fatty acid β-oxidation \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\]. It also participates in the regulation of cellular functions such as apoptosis \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nSprícigo et al. observed that on in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes, the translocation of active mitochondria was induced from the periphery of the cytoplasm to the interior or medullar region of the cytoplasm of the oocyte, which favors embryonic development \\[[@B7-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Similarly, when the media was supplemented with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during IVM, the oocyte accelerated its nuclear maturation, increased the number of active mitochondria, and decreased the levels of lipid droplets \\[[@B7-ijms-21-05601],[@B8-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Likewise, the addition of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine increased the embryo hatching percentage, an effect attributed to the improvement of embryo quality and its competence for development due to the reduction of lipid content and its developmental competence \\[[@B8-ijms-21-05601],[@B9-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Moreover, supplementation with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine has demonstrated to improve the survival rate of embryos subjected to vitrification/heating, an effect related to the variation in the content of lipids present in the embryo \\[[@B8-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In addition to its metabolic function, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine has been considered as a potent antioxidant that reduces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases the frequency of apoptosis in animal cells \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601]\\]. However, inconsistent results have been reported in terms of embryonic development when vitrified/heated bovine oocytes previously ripened in the presence of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine have been used \\[[@B7-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nWe previously found that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine used during IVM improved the cumulus cell expansion with no effect on embryo rate on day eight of development \\[[@B11-ijms-21-05601]\\]. However, embryo quality has not been assessed. With the working hypothesis that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine could be implicated in the metabolism of bovine embryo cultured in vitro, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine, supplemented during the in vitro maturation and culture processes, on the embryo quality expressed as the mitochondrial activity, lipid content, total cell number, gene expression, and cryotolerance.\n\n2. Results {#sec2-ijms-21-05601}\n==========\n\nFor testing the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine on the embryo production rate, a total of 843 oocytes were processed in four independent experiments from IVM until day eight of the in vitro culture. No significant differences (*p* \\> 0.05) in the cleavage rate at 66 hours post-insemination (hpi) were found between oocytes maturated with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine and the control group ([Table 1](#ijms-21-05601-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). In the same way, early embryo development rate (four cells stage) did not significantly differ (*p* \\> 0.05) between oocytes maturated with or without [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine ([Table 1](#ijms-21-05601-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\nAfter late in vitro culture, when the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine (1.5 mM) was added in groups 3 and 4 at 66 hpi, to test the effect on in vitro culture, the proportion of day eight blastocysts did not significantly differ (*p* \\> 0.05) between all four groups ([Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}.). The effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation on fatty acid modulation, mitochondrial activity, and total cell number was evaluated through staining methods by observation under fluorescence microscopy. The [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine addition in the culture media during in vitro maturation and late in vitro culture showed that the relative fluorescence in the group 2 (87.30% ± 2.63), group 3 (88.22% ± 3.9), and group 4 (82.61% ± 1.95), were lower than the control group (100% ± 2.56), demonstrating a reduction in mitochondrial activity ([Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\nOn the other hand, when [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was used as a lipid content modulator in bovine embryos, the supplementation with 3.8 mM of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation (group 2; 88.98 ± 4.2%) had a statistically significant difference (*p* \\< 0.05) compared to the control group (group 1; 100 ± 3.79%). However, none of the embryos from the treatment group 3 (95.8 ± 2.3%) and group 4 (91.47 ± 2.5%) showed a statistically significant difference (*p* \\> 0.05) compared to group 1 and group 2 ([Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\nAt day eight post-insemination, the expanded blastocysts from all treatments were stained with Hoechst 33342 to determine the total cell number (TCN) as an indicator of embryo quality indicator. As shown in [Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}, the addition of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during IVM (3.8 mM) and IVC (1.5 mM) did not show a statistically significant difference (*p* \\> 0.05) between groups.\n\nIn order to assess the cryotolerance of in vitro produced embryos using [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine, a total of 149 expanded blastocysts from all treatments were subjected to the vitrification process. After at least two weeks in liquid nitrogen, embryos were warmed and subsequently transferred to the incubator in culture media without [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine. The recovery rate was 95.3% (142/149), and the reexpansion processes and hatching process were recorded during the following 18, 24, 36, and 60 h post-warming. The data did not fit a normal distribution. However, the reexpansion after warming was 100% in all treatments and the kinetics of embryonic hatching after warming post-vitrification was recorded ([Figure 1](#ijms-21-05601-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We did not find statistically significant differences (*p* \\> 0.05) between treatments at any time assessed.\n\nWhen the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was assessed on the relative expression of transcript candidates, we found that the expression profile for *slc27a4*, *slc22a5*, *shc1*, *shc*, *bax*, *ifn-t*, and *ptgs2* genes significantly increased (*p* \\< 0.05) in group 3 (embryos cultured with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine at late IVC) compared to group 1 (control group; [Figure 2](#ijms-21-05601-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Furthermore, in groups 2 and 4, the relative abundance of *slc27a4* and *slc22a5* genes, significantly differed from group 3, but not from group 1. In the case of the *IFN-t* transcript, group 3 had shown a statistically significant difference with all the other experimental groups, and groups 2 and 4 had a difference with group 1. For *dgat1*, *dgat2*, *tp53*, and *plac8*, we did not find a statistically significant difference.\n\n3. Discussion {#sec3-ijms-21-05601}\n=============\n\nIn this work, we showed that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added at 3.8 and 1.5 mM during in vitro maturation and in vitro culture of bovine embryos, respectively, reduced the mitochondrial activity in the developed embryos. Also, the addition of 3.8 mM [l-]{.smallcaps}carnitine during in vitro maturation significantly affected lipid mobilization. Finally, the addition of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine in the late culture significantly improved the expression of a group of genes implicated in embryo metabolism such as *slc27a4*, *slc22a5*, *shc1*, *shc*, *bax*, and in maternal recognition of pregnancy, such as the *ifn-t* and *ptgs2* genes, compared to the control group. The expression of other genes significantly varied between groups treated with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation (oocytes) and in vitro culture (developed embryos). [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine has been used in the in vitro embryo production process by its capability to enhance lipid metabolism.\n\nControversial results are reported on the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine on cleavage rates of porcine oocytes \\[[@B12-ijms-21-05601]\\] or the development of porcine embryos \\[[@B13-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In our work, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine did not have effect on cleavage rate and the four-cells embryo stage, in agreement with previous reports \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601],[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B14-ijms-21-05601],[@B15-ijms-21-05601],[@B16-ijms-21-05601],[@B17-ijms-21-05601]\\], despite slight differences in the concentrations used and the development stage evaluated by these authors. Also, our work showed that supplementation with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation, and late in vitro culture did not affect the blastocysts rate, in agreement with the reports by Held-Hoeker et al. (using 2.5 mM of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine in Synthetic Oviductal Fluid (SOF) media during in vitro culture) \\[[@B16-ijms-21-05601]\\], Knitlova et al. using 2.5 mM of [l-]{.smallcaps}carnitine in the maturation media in meiotically more competent oocytes derived from medium-sized follicles (6--10 mm) \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\], and Zolini \\[[@B17-ijms-21-05601]\\] using 1.5 mM and 3.03 mM of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during the embryo culture. In our study, no effect of 1.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was observed in the early embryo development rates during the in vitro culture. Ghanem reported a significant reduction in embryo rate production using 1.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro culture \\[[@B15-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Most authors use the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation with no addition during in vitro culture \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601],[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B14-ijms-21-05601],[@B15-ijms-21-05601],[@B17-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Phongnimitr et al. found that 0.6 mg/mL [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine improved the blastocyst production rate from 23.4 (control group) to 29.7% ([l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine group) \\[[@B14-ijms-21-05601]\\], and Knitlova \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\] found that 2.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine improved the embryo production rate from meiotically less competent oocytes (33.3%) compared to the control group (25.83%). These studies suggest that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine can exert beneficial effects on in vitro produced embryos only under specific conditions and quality of oocytes used in the system.\n\nIn our study, the mitochondrial activity was significantly reduced (*p* \\< 0.05) when adding [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine (groups 2, 3, and 4; [Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). The use of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine as a modulator and stimulator of mitochondrial activity through the beta-oxidation pathway during oocyte maturation has been previously reported \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601],[@B18-ijms-21-05601]\\], but no studies are available on the addition of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine in the in vitro culture and early embryonic development. Oxidative metabolism is the leading source for ATP in early (pre compaction) embryonic stages, with sodium pyruvate being the preferred tricarboxylic acid substrate \\[[@B19-ijms-21-05601]\\]. [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine could work as a co-factor in the ATP production (for the β-oxidation process), improving the efficiency of ATP production by competent embryos while rescuing embryos that would otherwise fail to develop \\[[@B19-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In our work, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine significantly reduced the mitochondrial activity of the embryos, a finding that could be explained by the Leese \"hypothesis\", which states that embryos cultured under the appropriate culture conditions reduce its oxygen consumption until achieving basal metabolism \\[[@B20-ijms-21-05601]\\]. These embryos could be subjected to less damage to the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, or could be better equipped to deal with damage when it occurs, devoting fewer resources to \"running repairs\" \\[[@B20-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nIn addition, the lipid content was reduced in the blastocysts when [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine (3.8 mM) was added during the in vitro maturation (group 2) in comparison with the control group (group 1; [Table 2](#ijms-21-05601-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). This result is similar to that reported by Takahashi et al. who found a reduction in lipid content using 3.03 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during the in vitro embryo culture \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Also, Baldoceda et al. showed that adding 0.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine significantly reduced the number of lipid droplets in *Bos taurus* embryos \\[[@B18-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In our work, we used COCs harvested from ovaries of mixed *Bos indicus* breeds (Zebu cattle) where lipid content has been reported to be lower \\[[@B21-ijms-21-05601]\\], a fact that could explain the lack of statistically significant differences in fluorescence intensity.\n\nIn this study, no effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was found on the TCN of in vitro produced embryos, in agreement with the reports by Mishra et al. using 10 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation \\[[@B22-ijms-21-05601]\\], and Knitlova et al. using 2.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine (C0283) during in vitro maturation in meiotically less competent oocytes derived from small follicles (\\<5 mm) \\[[@B6-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In contrast, other researchers found improved TCN when adding [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation or in vitro culture \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B14-ijms-21-05601],[@B15-ijms-21-05601],[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added during maturation or in vitro culture may or may not affect the total number of embryonic cells.\n\nOur study showed that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine did not affect the re-expansion and hatching rates after blastocysts warming, independently of the embryo production stage in which [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was added. A possible explanation could be the lack of statistically significant differences in the lipid content of the embryos between treatments. Additionally, in the culture media used for the in vitro embryo production, BSA and FBS were added, which have been associated with a reduction of embryonic cryotolerance by stimulating the formation of lipid droplets \\[[@B24-ijms-21-05601],[@B25-ijms-21-05601],[@B26-ijms-21-05601],[@B27-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Also, in our work, we used [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine at different concentrations, during in vitro maturation, late in vitro culture (after 48 h) together and separately, with no effect on embryonic cryotolerance in agreement with reports by Phongnimitr et al. who used 0.6 mg/mL [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during maturation \\[[@B14-ijms-21-05601]\\], Sprícigo et al. where 3.03 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was added to the in vitro maturation of calf oocytes \\[[@B7-ijms-21-05601]\\], Saravia et al. where 3.72 mM (0.06 mg/mL) [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was added (Sigma C0158 inner salt) to the vitrification solutions for bovine embryos \\[[@B28-ijms-21-05601]\\], and Zolini et al. who used 3.03 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation and 0.75, 1.5 and 3.03 mM during the in vitro culture.\n\nIn contrast, Takahashi and colleagues found that adding 1.5 or 3.03 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro culture improved the survival rates after slow-freezing \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Chankitisakul and others showed that adding 3.03 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro maturation and later vitrifying the oocytes, significantly improved the embryo production rate, attributed to [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine-mediated lipid modulation \\[[@B29-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In the study by Ghanem et al., using 1.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during late in vitro culture (eight-cell stage), the survival rate was not affected but the hatching rate was significantly improved \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Lowe et al., working with porcine embryos, demonstrated significantly improved post-warming survival rate with 3 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro culture depending on the media system used \\[[@B13-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Held-Hoeker and colleagues showed that 2.5 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added in SOF medium during in vitro culture significantly improved the post-warming hatching rate of bovine embryos \\[[@B16-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Verma et al. found that adding 1.5 or 2 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine on mSOF medium (without FBS) during in vitro culture, significantly improved the post-thawing survival rate in buffalo embryos \\[[@B30-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The discrepancies between these studies in terms of the effects of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation on embryonic cryotolerance are likely due to the differences in terms of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine concentrations, the molecular weight of the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine used, the culture media used, and the presence or absence of several macromolecules, including FBS and BSA \\[[@B17-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nIn this study, we found an upregulation of the relative mRNA abundance of *slc27a4* in groups 3 and 4 compared with the control group. *Slc27a4* is involved in the translocation of long-chain fatty acids through the plasma membrane. Besides, *Slc27a4* plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the substrates of free fatty acids from exogenous sources when there is an increase in beta-oxidation or triglycerides synthesis. The SLC27A4 protein has Acyl-CoA ligase activity for long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids so that it may participate as a facilitator in beta-oxidation. Our result is in agreement with the report by Ghanem et al. \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Similarly, we found a significant increase in the expression of the *slc22a5* gene (a gene encoding the organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCNT2) protein) in embryos added with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during in vitro culture (group 3), compared to other [l-]{.smallcaps}carnitine treated groups (groups 2 and 4) and the control group (group 1). The increased expression of the *slc22a5* gene is associated with increased production of the OCNT2 protein, which is responsible for transporting [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine from the extracellular medium into the embryonic cells. However, we did not evaluate the expression of OCNT2. We found no effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine on the relative expression of *dgat1* and *dgat2* genes, where, in contrast to the result reported by Ghanem et al. \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\], Verma et al. \\[[@B30-ijms-21-05601]\\] found a significant reduction of *dgat1* and *dgat2* gene expression using [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine.\n\nApoptosis could be induced via oxidation by ROS generation when oocytes or embryos are cultured in vitro, and [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine reduces oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by increasing intracellular glutathione levels and affecting mitochondrial functions \\[[@B31-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Thus, we examined the expression of *bax*, *tp53*, and *shc1shc* (P66^shc^) genes related to apoptosis, and found that [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine significantly upregulated the expression of the stress sensor gen *p66^shc^* and the pro-apoptotic *bax* gene, in agreement with the report by You and colleagues using 10 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine on pig embryos \\[[@B31-ijms-21-05601]\\]. This result is contrary to previous reports \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B22-ijms-21-05601],[@B30-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The *p66^Shc^* is involved in signaling pathways that regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress and life span \\[[@B32-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Also, *p66^Shc^* acts as a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is essential for the ability of stress-activated p53 to trigger intracellular ROS generation and apoptosis \\[[@B32-ijms-21-05601]\\], and regulates intracellular ROS-induced DNA damage leading to permanent embryo arrest and apoptosis \\[[@B32-ijms-21-05601]\\]. We concluded that *bax* expression may not be a good indicator to predict the developmental competence of oocytes and embryos as supported by You et al. \\[[@B31-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nInterferon tau (IFN-t) is one of the genes mostly associated with the quality of in vitro produced embryos; it codes for a protein transcribed from multiple genes (there are at least 12 variants of cDNA) in trophoblast cells \\[[@B33-ijms-21-05601]\\]. IFN-t is the molecule responsible for maternal recognition of pregnancy in ruminants, a process that prevents luteolysis from occurring. In addition to its anti-luteolytic effect, the paracrine effects of IFN-t promote embryonic development and endometrial receptivity by stimulating the expression of genes related to elongation and implantation in the endometrium \\[[@B34-ijms-21-05601]\\]. In this work, we demonstrated that adding [l-]{.smallcaps}carnitine significantly upregulates the expression of INF-t during the in vitro culture, in agreement with other reports \\[[@B15-ijms-21-05601],[@B23-ijms-21-05601],[@B30-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Accordingly, it can be argued that blastocysts cultured in the presence of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine may most likely be able to survive after the transfer, by increasing INF-t production as previously reported \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nIn the same way, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2; also known as Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), which are one of the most important mediators of embryo-uterine communication at the initiation of implantation \\[[@B35-ijms-21-05601]\\]. We observed a higher expression of PTGS2 in group 3. In bovine embryos, the PTGS2 protein is located in trophectoderm cells. The higher expression observed in group 3 could be due to an altered proportion of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells \\[[@B36-ijms-21-05601]\\]. However, the expression of PTGS2 is more abundant in blastocysts resulting in a live-born calf compared with those resulting in resorption. PTGS2 gene expression increased throughout the implantation window, which indicates an essential role in prostaglandins released by the embryo in mediating interactions with the uterus \\[[@B37-ijms-21-05601]\\]. On the other hand, a direct effect between the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation and *inf-t* and *ptgs2* gene expression is unknown. However, the upregulation of these genes could be an indicator of an improvement in embryo quality when the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine is used during late in vitro culture without affecting the embryo production rate.\n\nIn summary, 1.5 mM of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine can be used as a supplement in the in vitro embryo production as a metabolism modulator; it appears to improve the embryos' \"quiet\" metabolism and expression of genes such as *inf-t* and *ptgs2* associated with better embryo quality. Moreover, post-thaw cryotolerance in vitro was not affected by [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation during maturation nor by supplementation during culture \\[[@B17-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Further research could be indicated to assess the effect of the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during the addition of in vitro culture medium in the pregnancy rate after embryo transfer of in vitro-produced embryos.\n\n4. Materials and Methods {#sec4-ijms-21-05601}\n========================\n\nThe Institutional Board on Animal Subject Experimentation from the University of Antioquia approved this work (act 115 of 6 February 2018).\n\n4.1. Experimental Design {#sec4dot1-ijms-21-05601}\n------------------------\n\n[l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine was added at different preimplantation stages, 3.8 mM was used on in vitro maturation \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B14-ijms-21-05601]\\] and 1.5 mM on late in vitro culture \\[[@B15-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Embryos from the control group (untreated) were not supplemented with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine. [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine ([l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine inner salts, Sigma-Aldrich St Louis, MO, USA, Product number C0158) was selected according to our previous results \\[[@B11-ijms-21-05601],[@B38-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were randomly allocated to either the control group (No addition of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine) or the treatment group, which received 3.8 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine. Afterward, oocytes were in vitro fertilized and cultured. Furthermore, in the late in vitro culture (day 3, from four cells stage until day 8 blastocyst), each group from the in vitro maturation groups was separated into two new groups for a total of four groups: group 1, control group (non [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplemented); group 2, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added during in vitro maturation (3.8 mM); group 3, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added during the in vitro culture (1.5 mM), and group 4, [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine added during maturation and culture (3.8 mM, and 1.5 mM respectively).\n\n4.2. Oocyte Collection {#sec4dot2-ijms-21-05601}\n----------------------\n\nBovine ovaries were obtained post-mortem from cycling cows (as evidenced by the presence of corpus luteum) at a slaughterhouse. The recovered ovaries were placed in bags with sterile saline phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at 35 °C and were transported (approximately within 30 min) to the laboratory for processing. In the laboratory, under sterile conditions, the ovaries were washed three times with 1× PBS at 35 °C to remove contaminating material, blood, and tissue debris. Then with a 10 mL syringe using 18 G needles, follicles with a diameter of 3 to 6 mm were aspirated. The follicular fluid was collected in 50 mL conical tubes placed in a water bath at 35 °C. Subsequently, follicular aspirates were filtered using a 70 μM pore diameter filter and oocytes from were placed in a 60 × 15 mm sterile petri dish containing 3 mL of 1× PBS. Good quality cumulus-oocyte complex (COCs) were selected according to previously established criteria \\[[@B39-ijms-21-05601],[@B40-ijms-21-05601]\\], under high stereomicroscope vision. Selected COCs were washed three times in Medium 199, Hanks' Balanced Salts (Gibco™ Gaithersburg, MD, USA, Catalog number: 12350039) before their transfer to the maturation medium.\n\n4.3. Oocyte Maturation {#sec4dot3-ijms-21-05601}\n----------------------\n\nCOCs (*n* = 10/each treatment) were placed in drops of 50 µL of maturation Medium 199, Hanks' Balanced Salts (Gibco™, Catalog number: 12350039), containing 25 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-glutamine, 6 mg/mL Fraction V Albumin (BSA), 3% FBS, 25 µg/mL FSH (Folltropin), 5 IU/mL LH (Chorulon), 1 µg/mL 17-beta estradiol, 0.30 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 µM ascorbic acid, and covered with mineral oil in a 35 mm culture dish. COCs were randomly allocated to either the control group or the treatment group, which received 3.8 mM [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation \\[[@B11-ijms-21-05601],[@B14-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Each group was incubated at 38.5 °C, 5% CO~2~ in the air with 90% relative humidity for 24 h.\n\n4.4. Oocyte Fertilization {#sec4dot4-ijms-21-05601}\n-------------------------\n\nIn vitro-matured COCs were fertilized with frozen-thawed bovine sperm from a batch that had previously been used in our laboratory. COCs (10/drop) were transferred to 50 μL FERT-TALP medium (IVL02, Caisson Laboratories, 836 South 100 East Smithfield, UT 84335) supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL Heparin (Sigma H0519), 1 mM Hypotaurine (Sigma H1384), 250 mM Epinephrine (Sigma E4642), 2 mM Penicillamine (Sigma P4875), and 1x antibiotic solution (ICN 1670049 MP Biomedicals, Fisher Scientific Company, Ottawa, ON, USA). Semen was thawed at 36 °C for 1 min, and motile spermatozoa were separated using percoll gradients (Allgrad^®^ 90% and 45% LifeGlobal group, 393 Soundview Rd, Guilford, CT 06437) by centrifugation at 780× *g* for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was diluted with 300 μL of FERT-TL media, and the final concentration was adjusted at 2 × 10^6^ sperm/mL, and added in each drop containing COCs \\[[@B11-ijms-21-05601]\\]. COCs and semen were incubated for 18 to 20 h at 38.5 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO~2~ in air \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601],[@B41-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.5. Assessment of Embryo Culture and Development {#sec4dot5-ijms-21-05601}\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAt 18 hpi, presumptive zygotes were stripped from cumulus cells and cultured (10/drop) in drops of 70 μL of Synthetic Oviductal Fluid (SOF; IVL05, Caisson Laboratories, 836 South 100 East Smithfield, UT 84335) supplemented with 6 mg/ml BSA-FAF, 1× antibiotic solution, and 3% FBS, at 38.5 °C, 5% CO~2~ and 90% relative humidity. At 48 h after the initiation of culture, the cleavage rate was determined from the total number of oocytes placed for insemination. To evaluate the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine during late IVC (66 hpi), embryos were divided into four groups, group 3 and group 4 were supplemented with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine (1.5 mM) until day 8 \\[[@B10-ijms-21-05601],[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The in vitro embryo production rate on day eight was determined based on the total number of inseminated oocytes \\[[@B42-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.6. Determination of Mitochondrial Activity in Embryos Cultured in the Presence of [l]{.smallcaps}-Carnitine {#sec4dot6-ijms-21-05601}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe embryos' mitochondrial activity was assessed with Mitotracker green fluorescent dye. All groups of embryos (blastocyst and expanded blastocyst) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in Dulbecco's PBS with 125 nM Mitotracker, according to the manufacturer's recommendations \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601]\\]. After this time, the excess dye was removed by washing twice with Dulbecco's PBS. Embryos were passed in groups of five structures to 10 μL Dulbecco's PBS drops on a slide \\[[@B43-ijms-21-05601]\\]. For its lecture, a B-2E/C filter was used at 480 nm and 520 nm wavelength excitation emissions, respectively. Images were recorded in \\*.TIF format and the results of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were assessed using the ImageJ software (Version 1.41; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The MFI of embryos in the control group was used as a normalizer for the fluorescence intensity measurement of embryos in the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine groups \\[[@B44-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.7. Determination of Lipid Droplets in Embryos Cultured in the Presence of [l]{.smallcaps}-Carnitine {#sec4dot7-ijms-21-05601}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to determine the content of lipid droplets, blastocysts, and the expanded blastocyst of each group were stained with Nile Red. First, embryos were incubated at 4 °C for 40 min in a 1.5 mL conical tube containing 250 μL of fixation medium (1× Dulbecco's PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde and 3 mg/mL of polyvinylpyrrolidone). After incubation, embryos were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS and passed to a 1.5 mL tube with 250 μL of Nile red solution (10 μg/mL) at room temperature for 4 h \\[[@B45-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Subsequently, the excess dye was removed by washing twice with Dulbecco's PBS, and embryos were placed on a slide in a 10 μL Dulbecco's PBS drop \\[[@B43-ijms-21-05601]\\]. They were observed under a 20× objective using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Melville, NY, USA) with a G-2A filter at an excitation wavelength of 510--560 nm and 580 nm emission. The embryo area was adjusted, and images were recorded in \\*.TIF format. The fluorescence intensity of the lipid droplets in the embryos was analyzed using the ImageJ software (Version 1.41; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The MFI of the embryos in the control group was used as a normalizer for the MFI measurement of embryos in the [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine groups \\[[@B44-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.8. Quantification of Cellularity in Bovine Embryos Cultured in the Presence of [l]{.smallcaps}-Carnitine {#sec4dot8-ijms-21-05601}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to evaluate the effect of [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine supplementation during oocytes in vitro maturation and in vitro early development processes on embryo cellularity, we used staining with Hoechst 33342 \\[[@B46-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Expanded blastocysts obtained in each treatment were incubated in the dark for 10 s in PBS with 0.2% (*v*/*v*) Triton 100X, BSA (2 mg/mL). Later, embryos were washed twice and stained with Hoechst 33342 (H1399 ThermoFisher; 10 μg/mL) for 30 min at room temperature. The embryos were washed twice with PBS-BSA and transferred to a 10 μL drop on a slide and covered with coverslips with a little drop of Vaseline in the corners, adding pressure until the pellucid zone was broken \\[[@B46-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The cell count was performed in the ImageJ program version 1.41, on a digital photograph obtained from a microscope (Nikon^®^ eclipse 80i, Melville, NY, USA). The blue cells were visualized under the UV2E fluorescence filter with a 360 nm excitation length and emission at 460 nm. The total cell number was determined \\[[@B46-ijms-21-05601],[@B47-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.9. Vitrification, Warming, and Subsequent Embryo Culture {#sec4dot9-ijms-21-05601}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA total number of 149 embryos were vitrified by using the Cryotech vitrification kit 101 (Reprolife, Tokyo, Japan). Five replicates were conducted. Expanded blastocysts were used to the vitrification process following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the embryos were transferred to the equilibration solution (ES) for 5 min at room temperature. Later, the embryos were transferred to tge vitrification solution (VS) and left there for up to 60 s. Subsequently, pools of five embryos from the same treatment were put in the cryotec support and immediately submerged into liquid nitrogen. Afterward, the cap was placed and stored in a nitrogen tank until their future warming \\[[@B48-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\nFor warming, the embryos were warmed using the Cryotech warming kit 102 (Reprolife, Tokyo, Japan). Quickly, after removal of the cap, each Cryotop strip that contained the embryos, was placed in a warming solution (TS) drop of 100 µL and waited for 1 min. After that time, embryos were transferred to the diluent solution (DS) and waited for 3 min. Then, embryos were washed twice in washing solution (WS), waiting 5 min each time. Later, each embryos group was transferred to the SOF medium drops (70 µL) and were cultured for 60 h for their posterior re-expansion and hatching assessment \\[[@B48-ijms-21-05601]\\]. Furthermore, the percentages of the embryos that resumed their development and reached a more advanced developmental stage after culture (development rate), as well as the hatching rates, were recorded \\[[@B49-ijms-21-05601]\\].\n\n4.10. RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Quantification of mRNA Transcript Abundance {#sec4dot10-ijms-21-05601}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelative mRNA abundance analysis was performed in three biological replicates, each containing 10 expanding blastocysts per experimental group obtained on day 7 and day 8 post-fertilization, using the Dynabeads^®^ mRNA DIRECT™ Micro Kit (Ambion^®^, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Oslo, Norway), following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications \\[[@B23-ijms-21-05601],[@B50-ijms-21-05601],[@B51-ijms-21-05601]\\]. After 10 min of incubation in lysis buffer with Dynabeads, poly (A) RNA attached to the Dynabeads was extracted with a magnet and washed twice in washing buffer A, and washing buffer B. RNA was eluted with Tris-HCl. Immediately after extraction, the RT reaction was carried out with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Oslo, Norway). Using poly (T) primers, random primers, and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) High-Performance Reverse Transcriptase enzyme, mixed in a total volume of 40 µL, in order to prime the RT reaction and produce cDNA. Tubes were heated to 70 °C for 5 min to denature the secondary RNA structure, and then the RT mix was completed with the addition of 50 IU of reverse transcriptase. Next, the tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min to promote the annealing of random primers, for 60 min at 42 °C to allow the RT of RNA, and finally at 70 °C for 5 min to denature the enzyme.\n\nAll mRNA transcripts were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and were run in the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, followed by a final extension step for 10 s. Two replicates for all genes of interest were performed in the Rotorgene 6000 Real-Time Cycler TM (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) by adding a 2 mL aliquot of each sample to the PCR mix (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) containing the specific primers selected to amplify the genes of interest. The comparative cycle threshold (CT) method was used to quantify expression levels. The values were normalized to the endogenous controls (housekeeping gene---histone H2AFZ) \\[[@B52-ijms-21-05601],[@B53-ijms-21-05601]\\]. According to the comparative CT method, the ΔCT value was determined by subtracting the HK mean CT value for each sample from each gene CT value of the sample. The calculation of ΔΔCT involved using the highest treatment ΔCT value, i.e., the treatment with the lowest target expression as an arbitrary constant to subtract from all other ΔCT sample values. Fold changes in the relative gene expression of the target were determined using the 2^−ΔΔCT^ formula \\[[@B54-ijms-21-05601]\\]. The primers used for the qPCR were as follows---H2A histone family, member Z (*h2afz*), long-chain fatty acid transport protein 4 (*slc27a4*), membrane transport protein associated with [l]{.smallcaps}-carnitine deficiency (*slc22a5*), Tumor protein p53 (*tp53*), Bcl-2-associated X protein (*bax*), SHC transformant protein 1 (*shc1 shc*), interferon tau (*ifn-t*), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (*ptgs2*), Placenta-specific gene 8 protein (*plac8*), and Diacyl glycerol transferase 1 and 2 (*dgat1* and *dgat2*). The primer sequences and the approximate sizes of the amplified fragments of all the transcripts are shown in [Table 3](#ijms-21-05601-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\n4.11. Statistical Analysis {#sec4dot11-ijms-21-05601}\n--------------------------\n\nData from all experiments were performed at least in three independent replicates for each treatment, and at least 15 embryos from each treatment were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using the general linear model (GLM) procedure. The results were expressed as mean ± SEM. All percentage data were arcsine-transformed before analysis. Data on the embryo production rate, mitochondrial activity, relative lipid content, total cell number, cryotolerance, and relative mRNA abundance were analyzed using an ANOVA, with a statistically significant value considered at *p* \\< 0.05. The differences between the treatments were compared using the Tukey LSD test. The program used was Statistica, version 10.0 (StatSoft Inc.

{"text": "The present invention concerns a process heating plant comprising a plurality of reaction chambers, preferably tubular cracking ovens intended for the production of hydrogen, which are heated by the cooling gas derived from a high-temperature reactor whereby the reaction chambers are installed together with the high-temperature reactor in one common pressure vessel made of pre-stressed concrete, and whereby additional energy-consuming components, such as steam generators, are installed in the gas cooling circuit of the reactor.\nIt is known practice to build nuclear power plants by the integrated construction method whereby, in addition to the reactor core, also a gas turbine, a compressor and components for heat exchange are all installed inside a common concrete pressure vessel. In German Offenlegungsschrift (DOS) No. 2,062,934 a gas-cooled nuclear reactor is described wherein the gas turbine has been installed in a hollow space in the wall of the pressure vessel which encloses the reactor core. Another nuclear reactor of similar construction is described in DOS No. 1,764,249. In that disclosure the nuclear reactor together with all components comprising the circuit are installed in tightly spaced, parallel and vertical bores inside the concrete pressure vessel and the components are accessible from the outside. Passages for the cooling medium are provided both in the wall of the pressure vessel and also between the several bores.\nFurthermore, a nuclear plant with a closed gas-cooling circuit supplying the necessary process heat has been proposed wherein the heat generated by a high-temperature reactor is first transferred to an intermediate circuit before being applied to its ultimate purpose, the process. The heat can be used, for instance, for the cracking of process gas in tubular cracking ovens and for the generation of electric power in steam turbine circuits. For such purposes, the components comprising the primary circuit, i.e., the reactor, heat exchangers, and blowers, are installed in cavities inside a concrete vessel, while the components comprising the process circuit as well as the circuit for the steam turbine are installed outside the safety vessel surrounding the reactor.\nThe two plants first referred to have two features in common: they are both equipped with a gas-cooling circuit completely integrated inside the concrete pressure vessel, and the energy generated by the reactor is utilized to drive a gas turbine and, subsequently, generate electric power. In contrast to the above, in the power plant mentioned last, the energy is first transferred to an intermediate circuit and then subsequently used for the generation of process gas.\nThe medium circulating in the secondary circuit may be a gas, for instance, helium. But a liquid heat-transfer medium may also be used. Such a plant is described in the German Auslegeschrift (DAS) No. 1,933,695, wherein the heat derived from the cooling medium in a nuclear reactor is transferred in a heat exchanger to molten lead, which, in turn, transfers it to a reaction system. The heat exchangers and the assembly of components in which the reaction takes place are installed in a common vessel and this vessel itself is installed, together with the nuclear reactor, in a common pressure vessel.\nAlso, from German Pat. Nos. 1,298,233 and 1,589,999 a method is known whereby the heat contained in the medium of a cooling circuit is directly applied to the components utilizing the process heat, without the use of an intermediate circuit. In the first disclosure, heated helium is conveyed so that it flows directly around the catalyst-filled tubes of a methane cracking plant. In the second patent, a process for the production of hydrogen is described wherein the energy obtained form the reactor is brought to a reaction chamber charged with a granulated metal oxide through which streams a mixture of steam and carbon monoxide.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Video game adaptations used to mean dressing up attractive actors in iconic costumes and trying to stuff 20 hours of gameplay into a 90-minute movie. It didn’t really work. Now, video game adaptations are more reliant on CGI versions of favorite childhood characters appearing both realistic and either terrifying or adorable. It’s the difference between Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and recent films like Rampage.\n\nDetective Pikachu director Rob Letterman knows how important nailing the CGI adaptation of beloved 2D characters is to ensuring longtime fans are on board. Getting it right leads to praise for a thoughtful reworking of a character like Pikachu or Bulbasaur. Getting it wrong, unfortunately, leads to the Sonic the Hedgehog fiasco.\n\nThe Verge caught up with Letterman shortly after news came out that Sonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler announced Sonic would get a redesign in Paramount’s live-action adaptation, following intense backlash online. Fowler didn’t suggest if the film’s release date would be pushed back to accommodate the overhaul.\n\nLetterman told The Verge he “just heard about the Sonic situation 15 minutes ago,” adding he didn’t envy the position that Fowler and Paramount have found themselves in. Deciding to alter a main character’s design just a few months ahead of its scheduled release probably wasn’t easy to do, Letterman says. Although he couldn’t speak to Fowler or Paramount’s process into reworking Sonic’s look, he did offer some insight into how impossible it would have been for his Detective Pikachu team to take on such a dramatic undertaking.\n\n“There’s no right or wrong to how you make one of these movies,” Letterman says. “It would be very difficult for us to redesign anything. We spent a year designing all the characters ahead of shooting so that we could get it all right. If we were off by an inch on Pikachu, [actor] Justice Smith’s performance would go right out the window. For us, it would have been impossible — but that doesn’t mean they can’t do it. I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes — they’re in a difficult spot.”\n\nTo say that Letterman and his team were obsessed with ensuring they did justice to game designer Ken Sugimori’s original pokémon illustrations is an understatement. They knew Detective Pikachu had to do more than pay homage to the creatures that evolved over the last three decades into a global phenomenon; they had to treat each design with the same respect they gave human actors.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes — they’re in a difficult spot.”\n\nThe design team behind Sonic the Hedgehog wasn’t so fortunate. Whereas adaptations of Pikachu and Psyduck in Detective Pikachu found a way into hesitant fans’ hearts, Sonic’s bizarre appearance struck fear into the hearts of blue hedgehog stans. His lanky, human legs combined with a mouthful of disturbing human teeth juxtaposed with his overall alien physique is uncomfortable to witness. It also begs the question: how could one movie seem to get it so right, while another got it so undeniably wrong?\n\nLetterman credits much of their design decisions to spending two years studying different animal designs and collaborating with the Pokémon Company design team in Japan to ensure everything worked.\n\n“We studied a lot of animals and how they behave and how they interact to ensure we got it right,” Letterman says. “Bulldogs, in particular, for Bulbasaur and how they act in packs or how they get you to pay attention. There’s an extraordinary amount of craft that went into making the movie on the animation side as we tried to bring everything to life.”\n\nIt worked. Detective Pikachu might have its flaws, but its depiction of pokémon is one of its biggest strengths.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a shield case for a semiconductor optical device. More specifically, the invention relates to a shield case to be mounted onto a circuit board with a semiconductor light-emitting or light-receiving device (may be hereinafter referred to as a \"semiconductor optical device\" as a general term inclusive for both the semiconductor light-emitting and light-receiving devices) placed therein shielded electromagnetically.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nIn a semiconductor optical device of this kind, a semiconductor light-emitting or light-receiving element (maybe hereinafter referred to as a \"semiconductor optical device\") is wire-bonded through metal wires to a plurality of lead terminals and then encapsulated by a mold resin into an encapsulated body in a rectangular parallelepiped form. This encapsulated body has, at a top surface, a transparent (or semi-transparent) semi-spherical lens formed of a synthetic resin covering over the semiconductor optical device. That is, the semiconductor optical device of this kind is generally in rectangular parallelepiped form having lead terminals extending outward through one surface of the encapsulated body.\nThere are cases that such a semiconductor optical device is mounted on a circuit board through using the lead terminals. In such cases, there encounters a problem that the mount stability becomes poor due to insufficiency in mechanical strength of the lead terminals and the affection of noises caused by the absence of a shield structure for prevention against electromagnetism.\nUnder such circumstances, a shield case formed by a magnetic metal plate, e.g., iron plate, having high magnetic permeability has been conventionally used, wherein the magnetic metal plate is blanked generally in a rectangular shape having opposite mount legs so that the magnetic metal plate is bent into an arch form having a top plate and opposite side plates. In the conventional shield case, the top plate has an opening through which a light-receiving/light-emitting surface of the semiconductor optical device is exposed while the side plates retain the semiconductor optical device therebetween. That is, the conventional shield case provides electromagnetic shield for the semiconductor optical device at three faces in total, i.e., the light-receiving/light-emitting surface except for a region of the opening plus opposite side surfaces. Due to this, the semiconductor optical device can be shielded from electromagnetism with enhanced mount stability.\nHowever, the conventional shield case involved a problem to be dissolved. That is, where utilizing the conventional shield case, the semiconductor optical device has been held by providing inward projections from the side plates or otherwise by attaching a separate fixing member to the inward of the side plates. In the former case, there has been a problem that there is difficulty in stably holding the semiconductor optical device. On the other hand, in the latter case the structure is complicated and hence cost is expensive.\nMoreover, because the conventional shield case is in the arch form, the semiconductor optical device is shielded at only three surfaces among six surfaces but the remaining three surfaces are left open, thus insufficiency in the effect of shield.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Here is our list of space policy events for the week of July 11-16, 2016 and any insight we can offer about them. The House and Senate are in session this week.\n\nDuring the Week\n\nThe Washington space policy community is still reeling from the news of Molly Macauley’s murder Friday night while walking her dogs near her home in Baltimore. Molly was one of the most respected and admired members of our relatively small group of space policy analysts and practitioners and was well-known to just about everyone in it. No word yet on funeral arrangements. We’ll certainly post any information we get. Molly was Vice President of Research and a Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank, which has posted a lovely tribute to her.\n\nMeanwhile, the work of the space policy community must go on. This is the last week Congress is scheduled to meet until after Labor Day, so there’s a lot they should be getting done. Whether they do or not remains to be seen with everyone focused on tragic deaths elsewhere in the country. Senate leaders tried to bring up the defense appropriations bill last week, but Democrats blocked it. They’re going to try again tomorrow. On Friday, the House approved a motion to go to conference on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), so that’s a step in that direction anyway, but authorization bills don’t provide any money. Only appropriations bills do that. There’s no indication when the Senate will resume consideration of the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill, which includes NASA and NOAA, and it is not on the House calendar either. The House and Senate will have four weeks after they return on September 6 to get some sort of appropriations passed to keep the government operating after FY2016 ends on September 30.\n\nThere are three congressional hearings about space this week. First is a House Science, Space, and Technology (SS&T) Committee hearing on “Astronomy, Astrophysics and Astrobiology” with witnesses talking about programs at NASA and the National Science Foundation. That begins at 10:00 am ET on Tuesday. An hour later (which means the two will overlap), the House Small Business Committee holds a hearing on the role of small business and NASA. It’s the first time we can think of that that committee has held a space hearing. Witnesses are from Explore Mars (Beverly, MA), Emergent Space Technologies (Greenbelt, MD), Craig Technologies (Cape Canaveral, FL) and Honeybee Technologies (Brooklyn, NY).\n\nOn Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) will chair only his third space hearing since becoming chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s Space, Science and Competitiveness Subcommittee at the beginning of 2015. He’s been busy running for President and reportedly will speak at the Republican Convention next week, but on Wednesday he will focus on “NASA At a Crossroads: Reasserting American Leadership in Space Exploration.” Witnesses are Bill Gerstenmaier from NASA; Mary Lynne Dittmar from the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration; Mike Gold from SSL (formerly Space Systems Loral); Mark Sirangelo from Sierra Nevada Corporation; and Dan Dumbacher, formerly NASA, now at Purdue. We published summaries of Cruz’s previous two space hearings: February 25, 2015 on U.S. Human Space Exploration Goals and Commercial Space Competitiveness and March 13, 2015 on NASA’s FY2016 budget request.\n\nThe American Astronautical Society, CASIS and NASA will hold the 5th International Space Station R&D conference in San Diego Tuesday-Thursday, with a special pre-conference session tomorrow afternoon on utilization of Japan’s Kibo module. The conference itself will be webcast — lots of really interesting speakers each day, including a conversation with Mark and Scott Kelly and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta on the Twins Study from Scott Kelly’s 340-day stay aboard ISS. Remember that all times in the agenda are in Pacific Daylight Time (Eastern Daylight Time – 3).\n\nTwo interesting national security space seminars also are on the docket this week. The Hudson Institute holds a meeting on Space and the Right to Self Defense on Wednesday afternoon to discuss a report it just published on that topic. The study director, Hudson Institute Fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs, will moderate a discussion with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl. Thursday morning, the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute will hold a breakfast meeting featuring Elbridge Colby of the Center for a New American Security on U.S. defense and deterrence strategy for space.\n\nThose and other events we know about as of Sunday morning are shown below.

{"text": "The Dilbert Future\n\nThe Dilbert Future (1997) is a book published by Scott Adams as a satire of humanity that breaks the net motivations of humanity down into stupidity, selfishness, and \"horniness\", and presents various ideas for profiting from human nature.  The final chapter invites the reader to ponder upon several open-ended questions, such as the nature of gravity and the utility of affirmations, which are further addressed in God’s Debris.\n\nAdams makes several \"predictions\" throughout the book intended for humorous effect: \n\n\"There will be two types of people: Superstars and perspiration wipers.  Those who are neither will be managers\"\n\"In the Future, the value of your job will decrease, thanks to the godforsaken hellhole of North Dakota\".\nThe book anticipates a fictional food item (which Adam references as the Dilberito) which is explained as a food source containing 100% of a human's daily nutritional requirements (the point being that otherwise an individual needs a supercomputer and a team of scientists to determine dietary needs.)\n\nScott Adams did publish in issue 15 of his Dilbert Newsletter (sent to all members of Dogbert's New Ruling Class) an excerpt from this book with permission  for it to be re-published (if kept with the copyright text).\n\nAdams introduced the word confusopoly in this book. The word is a portmanteau of confusion and monopoly (or rather oligopoly), defining it as \"a group of companies with similar products who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price\". Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, and financial services.

{"text": "It started as something of a prank almost two decades ago. Blur frontman Damon Albarn and comic-book artist Jamie Hewlett, flatmates at the time, were watching MTV and, hugely underwhelmed by the videos they saw – yep, music television actually once played music – decided to form a cartoon band. Three years later, their group, Gorillaz, had sold seven million copies of their eponymous debut album and been named the Most Successful Virtual Band by Guinness World Records.\n\nHow was it possible? Well, for starters, there was Albarn’s knack for infectious melodies and the canny melding of elements from alternative hip-hop and electro-pop, which spawned bona fide pop anthems such as Clint Eastwood. There was also his unerring choice of star collaborators, from rapper Snoop Dogg to Clash guitarist Mick Jones and even 77-year-old R&B legend Mavis Staples, who features on Gorillaz’ fifth album, Humanz.\n\nIt wasn’t just about the music, though. Hewlett – the artist behind iconic late ’80s comic character Tank Girl – crafted the perfect pop avatars to engage fans: cute but confused singer/keyboardist, 2D; Murdoc, the band’s evil mastermind bassist; formerly demonically possessed drummer, Russel; and Japanese guitar virtuosa, Noodle.\n\nEach has his/her own superpower and also a rich back-story that is expanded – often with surreal plot twists – with each Gorillaz release.\n\nThe new album is no exception: before the quartet met up in London to record Humanz, they were scattered across the globe. 2D was stranded on a supposedly deserted island where, due to his poor survival skills, he had to exist on rotten meat from the whale that had transported him there. Russel, who grew 60 times in size after eating radioactively contaminated fish, was captured in North Korea and exhibited in a cage as a Godzilla-like attraction. It was only when he reverted to normal, thanks to a limited diet, that the regime’s leader let him go. To cut a long story short, there was a lot to talk about when The Red Bulletin got the chance to interview the singer and drummer…\n\nTHE RED BULLETIN: Gorillaz have been a band for almost 20 years now, and in that time you’ve had to deal with some pretty hairy situations. What’s the secret of maintaining a successful working relationship amid the drama?\n\nRUSSEL: Restraining orders. Gotta love your British legal system. Nah, only kidding. But, you know, getting out of each other’s faces does help. Because we’re different people, [we’ve] all got our own thing going on. Noodle reads a lot of existentialist philosophy; I’m highly politicised; 2D likes finding shapes in the clouds, and Murdoc is just a terrible person.\n\nWhich of your fellow bandmates’ special skills have proven most useful over the years?\n\n2D: Noodle grew up in a super-soldier programme where she learned hand-to-hand combat and how to use heavy weapons. Those skills have helped us fight off pirates and zombies – and Murdoc when he’s drunk.\n\nRUSSEL: She used to choke him with a jujitsu move – but since he got into S&M, choking him only makes the situation worse. Now she just clips him with a tranq gun.\n\nRussel, imagine you’re in a recording session and 2D spontaneously combusts. Which singer would you replace him with?\n\nRUSSEL: First off, spontaneously combusts? If that happens, I’m asking some serious questions. Area would need to be locked down: nobody goes in or out, get forensics in. ’Cos people don’t just combust, y’know? Not in my lifetime.\n\n2D: What about that inflatable lady Murdoc kept in his cupboard?\n\nRUSSEL: Oh yeah. She lit up like the Fourth of July during a post-coital cigarette. But let’s suppose forensics found no foul play at the scene… If we had to replace 2D, maybe we’d bring in Shirley Bassey – a national treasure and she sings like an angel, just like 2D. Of course, that’d make Shirley the number one suspect in 2D’s vaporisation. She had the most to gain.\n\nI had knickers thrown at me once. I put them on a 60°C wash and gave them back 2D\n\nWhat’s the most ‘rock star’ thing you’ve ever done?\n\n2D: That’s more Murdoc’s department. I get a bit tired of the rock star stuff. Someone once threw their knickers at me on stage. They were dirty, so I took them home and put them on a 60°C wash. I gave them back to her at the next gig. Then she started bringing her laundry to me at every gig. It got quite time-consuming. Especially the woollens.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young, aspiring pop stars?\n\n2D: Being a pop star is cool sometimes, but not other times, like when people take photos of you going to the toilet. So I’d say, “Don’t get into it for fame; do it ’cos you enjoy it.” My favourite job was running the dodgems at Eastbourne funfair. I’d go back in a second, but Murdoc threatened to take me down, Gladiator-style, if I ever left Gorillaz. He has a whip and a trident, and a leather loincloth, so I know he’s serious.\n\n2D, which of the survival skills you learned on the desert island are proving most useful back in regular life?\n\n2D: Learning that you need very little to get by in life: just a fire and some food. It was an enlightening experience. I’m actually hoping to go back to the island some day – partly to learn more survival skills, and also ’cos I left one of my flip-flops. The flip, I think. Or maybe the flop. Never know which is which. The point is, they belong together – the distance must be really painful.\n\nIf there had been no whale to live off on that island and you’d been forced to cannibalise yourself, which of your own body parts would you eat first?\n\nRUSSEL: What is wrong with you, man? That’s messed up! What, you want me to say I’d chew on my big, sweet ass? That what you want? That I’d chew my own ass? No way I’m saying those words. You’d only quote me out of context. I know how you people work.\n\n2D: I’m a humanitarian, which means I don’t eat human meat. But you’d be surprised how much nourishment you can get from eating your clothes. I made quite a nice shredded T-shirt salad to accompany the whale blubber.\n\nRussel, on your latest adventure you grew 60 times your normal size. How does your perception of the world change when you’re a giant?\n\nRUSSEL: You learn that people can be very uncivilised when it comes to a person’s weight. They’re always judging. Sure, I was big, but I’ve got an underactive thyroid. People see a towering giant and assume you’re awake all night, sobbing into an empty tub of Cherry Garcia while listening to All By Myself by Celine Dion. It was MY THYROID!\n\nIf your new album, Humanz, were an iconic film, which would it be?\n\n2D: That’s not easy. Maybe Brazil [Terry Gilliam’s 1985 dystopian fantasy]. On the surface it’s quite fast-paced and seems light-hearted, but it’s actually a really dark fantasy about a scary new future.\n\nRUSSEL: Got to go deeper, man. Think about it… Maybe we’re all in a movie right now and we don’t even know it. A billion smartphone cameras pointed our way, and some psycho director calling the shots. Unplug, people. ’Cos when the credits roll, there won’t be no sequel.\n\nGorillaz © Press\n\nIn recent years, we’ve witnessed the rise of Japanese virtual pop star Hatsune Miku. What do you make of her and other animated musicians?\n\nRUSSEL: I’m no conspiracy nut, but I got some hard truths for you: most pop stars are animated. Every move they make is controlled, every word they breathe is scripted. But Gorillaz, we’ve got substance. We’re probably the most real thing out there.\n\nYour track Hallelujah Money is a cry for greater humanity. If we got rid of money, what could we use as currency?\n\nRUSSEL: What would be the point in getting rid of money just to swap it for a new currency? It’s still power in some other form, and power is what’s distributed unfairly. Forget currency, what we need is a global revolution, meaning complete constitutional demolition, then a new start with a rigorously egalitarian system.\n\n2D: Twiglets?\n\nOn June 10, you’ll be hosting your own one-day music festival, Demon Dayz, at Dreamland, an amusement park in Margate on the UK’s south-east coast. What can revellers expect?\n\n2D: Candyfloss, dodgems, and the smell of soggy chips: the three greatest things in the world. Unfortunately, the manager says I have to work that day.\n\nRUSSEL: What 2D’s getting at is all you folks with Demon Dayz tickets get to use the theme park, as well as catch Gorillaz at our first festival since the Escape To Plastic Beach World Tour. That was seven years ago. Whoa, a lot’s changed since then – Murdoc even became a feminist. Anyway, we got a crew of artists and friends joining us, but I can’t say much more about that now. You never know who’s reading.\n\nWhat would be your dream theme-park attraction?\n\n2D: A happy version of a ghost train, with tangerine trees and rocking-horse people, where you ride through the clouds on dodgems and get free candyfloss. No ghosts, though – that’s key. We see enough of them in our line of work.\n\nRUSSEL: Tell me about it. Ghosts really get under my skin. Literally. It’s kind of an affliction, harbouring the souls of dead rappers. Like having indigestion that rhymes. Personally, I don’t have time for theme-park rides. I’m too busy just clinging on to this out-of-control roller coaster we all ride, operated by The Man.\n\n2D: Do you mean Paul?\n\nRUSSEL: Who?\n\n2D: He runs the roller coaster at Dreamland.\n\nRUSSEL: No. The Man.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Michael D'Onofrio\n\nmcdonofrio@lohud.com\n\nCLARKSTOWN - The alleged tampering of a police department computer hard drive has led to the expansion of a town investigation into a suspended former police sergeant and Police Chief Michael Sullivan.\n\nFormer Police Sgt. Stephen Cole-Hatchard, who offered his resignation after being put on leave this weekend, allegedly removed the hard drive from his town-issued computer and later replaced it, said Clarkstown attorney Lino Sciarretta.\n\nThe timing suggests the possibility of a “cover up or improper illegal activities,” Sciaretta said, because Cole-Hatchard has filed a federal lawsuit against the town.\n\n“Removing the hard drive from his computer suggests that material contained on it may have been deleted. The very act of removing the hard drive leads to a number of possibilities that must be investigated,” Sciarretta said.\n\nThe allegations were revealed at the Town Board meeting, where upward of 90 people attended, including Sullivan. The vast majority of the people were there to support the suspended police chief.\n\nCLARKSTOWN LAWSUIT: Chief and special police unit racially profiled\n\nRELATED: Clarkstown sergeant sues Hoehmann, board\n\nRELATED: Clarkstown-Ramapo fingerpointing on police chief\n\nThe Town Board voted to authorize the town’s special prosecutor, William Harrington, to increase the scope of his investigation into Cole-Hatchard and Sullivan. Councilwoman Stephanie Hausner voting against it.\n\nHausner raised doubts at the meeting about whether the town should be conducting its own investigation when other law enforcement agencies were already administering their own investigations.\n\n“I feel this is part of their job, and I’m not sure if it’s appropriate for the town board to be investigating a … former employee,” Hausner said.\n\nSciarretta also said the manipulation of the hard drive was “pertinent” to the police chief’s disciplinary proceeding.\n\nSullivan called the investigation as a “witch hunt,” adding, “people think I’m being railroaded.\n\n“These allegations are completely false,” Sullivan said. “They are misleading and they are seriously hurting this police department, and seriously jeopardizing the safety of our officers and our public with this misleading, misrepresenting of the facts.”\n\nHoehmann said that he would defer all comments about ongoing litigation to the town attorney.\n\nSciarretta said that Cole-Hatchard’s computer was placed into evidence by the Clarkstown police department last Thursday in connection to the town's recently filed litigation against Cole-Hatchard and Sullivan.\n\nThe hard drive was discovered to have been allegedly tampered with over the weekend, Sciarretta said. It was not known when exactly the hard drive was allegedly removed and replaced.\n\nNEW CHARGES: Sullivan now facing 22 charges\n\nLAWSUIT: Sullivan sues for reinstatement as Clarkstown's top cop\n\nRELATED: Clarkstown police sergeant, placed on leave, resigns\n\nThe town filed counter claims, responding to Sullivan's legal action to end his suspension on 22 disciplinary charges, that a special police unit in the Clarkstown police department illegally profiled and investigated two black groups and some elected officials.\n\nRockland District Attorney Thomas Zugibe and Sullivan previously denied the allegations.\n\nChris Kiernan, president of Rockland County PBA, said the town’s special prosecutor was manipulating the town’s internal investigation by “leaking” information that was an “obvious parlor trick just to advance his public relations push against the police department.”\n\nKiernan described the town’s accusations of racial profiling by the Clarkstown police department as “unequivocally false,” “deplorable,” “disgusting,” and “dangerous.”\n\nSandra Siegel, a resident of New City, said she was \"disgusted\" with the town board, and called the investigations a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nAt the meeting, the Town Board also accepted Cole-Hatchard’s resignation. Cole-Hatchard previously claimed he has become a “scapegoat and sideshow” after being targeted for investigating political donations by former Sgt. Michael Garvey, who helped fund Hoehmann’s campaign for supervisor in 2015.\n\nTwitter: @mikedonofrio_", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Rainbow (ride)\n\nRainbow is the name of the amusement park ride created by HUSS Maschinenfabrik of Bremen, Germany which is now HUSS Park Attractions of Budapest, Hungary. The Rainbow was manufactured from 1983-2000 and is often confused with its cousins Ali Baba (ride) and 1001 Nachts but there are major differences between the ride designs. The HUSS Rainbow has developed a vast fan base due to its large stature, smooth ride and bright lights.\n\nThere were only 42 units produced which were found in many counties from Canada, United States, Australia, India, Africa, the middle east, Asia and Europe.\n\nStill today there are several Rainbows still in operation mainly in the United States and Europe. The most recent refurbishing was unveiled at the January 2014 South Florida Fair owned by Wade Shows.\n\nThe popularity of the classic ride has sparked its own (independently managed) Facebook page and several websites and forums dedicated to the Huss Rainbow.\n\nDesign\nThe Rainbow was developed in the early 1980s from the design of the Ranger (ride) also built by HUSS. Its gondola holds 32 passengers in 3 rows with 2 persons per seat. An electronic controlled lap-bar (similar to the ones installed on HUSS Pirate rides - but shaped very differently) holds passengers in. Later some models were required to upgrade with seatbelts for added safety.\n\nThe Rainbow came packaged on 3 (possibly 4) oversized trailers or installed as park models. It took a crew of 4, about 6 hours to set up and 4 hours to tear down. A crane is used to erect the main shaft.\n4 hydraulic motors drove the ride.\n\nAfter set up, the Rainbow stands 20 Meters (66 Feet) tall with an on-ride rainbow in lights and a large bright sun face in the middle of its long white main arm.\n\nThe overall theme varied slightly from unit to unit. Some seats were Orange, Some blue or white and the main arm displayed a V shaped stripe of varying colors. Of course, once it was sold its new owner could change it to fit their internal theme. The gondola sported illuminated clouds underneath which was one of the many trademarks of the rides style.\n\nOperation\nThe ride is run manually with a joy stick, apparently some models were programmed and ran from push-buttons.\n\nIt can move in either clock-wise or counter clock-wise direction with the ability of stopping or reversing at any point in its orbit. It was very customary to stop the ride in its up-most position and wait a while, then reverse directions.\n\nSafety features\nIt was equipped with lap bars that raise and lower electronically from the main control booth. Most models have a foot pedal to ensure the operator is present.\n\nIn about 2000, Huss required that all Rainbows were to be fitted with seatbelts, which caused many parks to sell their old Rainbows for Ali Baba type models.\n\nSome owners equipped their rides with cameras so the operator could see what the riders were doing while in motion, as a deterrent for guests who would slide from under the bars or stand up while the ride was in motion.\n\nAccidents\n\nOn July 15, 2008, 30 people were injured when a Rainbow collapsed at Liseberg theme park in Sweden.\n\nThe ride was dismantled on July 17, 2008. Investigators then confirmed on July 19, 2008 that they had discovered a faulty drive shaft during their inspection. They believed that one of the axles that is designed to hold the passenger carriage horizontal failed. HUSS ordered the temporary closure of 40 Rainbows.  The drive shaft was upgraded by HUSS in 2003, but by then many units had been scrapped or sold for parts.\n\nOn June 9, 2006, a 2-year-old boy broke his arms and legs after falling at least  from the “Over the Rainbow” ride at Dixie Landin’ in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was seated next to 3½-year-old sister but about  from his mother at the time; his mother says she was told that the other adjacent seat was out of order.\n\nAppearances \nThe following is a record of Huss Rainbow rides, their owners, locations and current status. The information gathered was known to be accurate at the time it was entered but as rides change hands often, can not always be verified as the current ride's status.

Net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, increased 11% to $3.68, including an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share if the Company were to translate prior year period results at current period foreign exchange rates (\"foreign currency translation\"), compared to $3.31 in the prior year period.

The first quarter 2020 financial results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year or any future period, particularly in light of the continuing effect of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nTotalrevenue in the first quarter increased 2% to $3.2 billion compared to the prior year period driven by 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 1% unfavorable impact from divestitures, net of acquisitions.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter decreased 4% to $2.2 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $91 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $40 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and the preemptive reduction and deferral of certain discretionary expenses in an effort to proactively manage liquidity due to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the Company, partially offset by $18 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, an increase in investments supporting growth initiatives and Aon Business Services, and an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates in the first quarter had an $8 million, or $0.03 per share, unfavorable impact on both U.S. GAAP net income and adjusted net income if the Company were to translate prior year period results at current quarter foreign exchange rates. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2020, an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020, and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nEffective tax rate used in the Company's U.S. GAAP financial statements in the first quarter was 19.3%, compared to 15.7% in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 19.3% compared to 16.9% in the prior year period, primarily driven by changes in the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items. The adjusted effective tax rate in the prior year period included a net favorable impact from discrete items.\n\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 234.5 million in the first quarter compared to 243.7 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 2.2 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $460 million in the quarter. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $1.6 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.\n\nYEAR TO DATE 2020 CASH FLOW SUMMARY\n\nCash flows provided by operations for the first three months of 2020 increased $264 million to $338 million compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement and near-term actions taken to improve working capital in an effort to proactively manage liquidity due to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and its impact on the Company. The prior year period included approximately $85 million of net cash payments related to legacy litigation.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, increased $262 million, to $279 million for the first three months of 2020 compared to the prior year period, reflecting an increase in cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $2 million increase in capital expenditures.\n\nFIRST QUARTER 2020 REVENUE REVIEW\n\nThe first quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow\" on page 9 of this press release.\n\nThree Months EndedMarch 31,\n\n(millions)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n%Change\n\nLess:CurrencyImpact\n\nLess:FiduciaryInvestmentIncome\n\nLess:Acquisitions,Divestitures& Other\n\nOrganicRevenueGrowth\n\nRevenue\n\nCommercial Risk Solutions\n\n$\n\n1,146\n\n$\n\n1,118\n\n3%\n\n(2)%\n\n—%\n\n1%\n\n4%\n\nReinsurance Solutions\n\n848\n\n788\n\n8\n\n(1)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n9\n\nRetirement Solutions\n\n397\n\n420\n\n(5)\n\n(1)\n\n—\n\n(4)\n\n—\n\nHealth Solutions\n\n502\n\n486\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n5\n\nData & Analytic Services\n\n331\n\n336\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1\n\nElimination\n\n(5)\n\n(5)\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nTotal revenue\n\n$\n\n3,219\n\n$\n\n3,143\n\n2%\n\n(2)%\n\n—%\n\n(1)%\n\n5%\n\nTotal revenue increased $76 million, or 2%, to $3,219 million compared to the prior year period, including organic revenue growth of 5%, primarily driven by strong new business generation in Reinsurance Solutions and strong management of the renewal book globally in Health Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions.\n\nCommercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 4% was driven by growth across every major geography, highlighted by double-digit growth in Canada and Latin America, primarily driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. On average globally, exposures and pricing were both modestly positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact overall.\n\nReinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong net new business generation globally in treaty and solid growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a modest decline in capital markets transactions. Results in the quarter include a modest positive impact from the timing of certain revenue, which will be spread evenly for the balance of 2020. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter.\n\nRetirement Solutions organic revenue growth was flat, driven by solid growth in Investments, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management, as well as modest growth in Human Capital, primarily for assessment services. Results in the quarter were offset by a decline in core retirement, reflecting a decrease in billable hours and discretionary project-related work, primarily as a result of COVID-19.\n\nHealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 5% was driven by growth across every major geography in health and benefits brokerage, highlighted by particular strength in Latin America, Asia, and the EMEA region. Results in the quarter also include growth in the active exchange business.\n\nData & Analytic Services organic revenue growth of 1% was driven by growth globally across the affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S. across both business and consumer solutions. Results in the quarter also reflect pressure in certain, more discretionary parts of the business, primarily as a result of COVID-19.\n\nFIRST QUARTER 2020 EXPENSE REVIEW\n\nThree Months EndedMarch 31,\n\n(millions)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n$ Change\n\n% Change\n\nExpenses\n\nCompensation and benefits\n\n$\n\n1,522\n\n$\n\n1,584\n\n$\n\n(62)\n\n(4)%\n\nInformation technology\n\n111\n\n117\n\n(6)\n\n(5)\n\nPremises\n\n73\n\n87\n\n(14)\n\n(16)\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets\n\n41\n\n40\n\n1\n\n3\n\nAmortization of intangible assets\n\n97\n\n97\n\n—\n\n—\n\nOther general expense\n\n342\n\n346\n\n(4)\n\n(1)\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n2,186\n\n$\n\n2,271\n\n$\n\n(85)\n\n(4)%\n\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased $62 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $26 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $24 million decrease in restructuring charges, and expense discipline, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth.\n\nInformation technology expense decreased $6 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an $11 million decrease in restructuring charges, partially offset by an increase in investments supporting growth initiatives and Aon Business Services.\n\nPremises expense decreased $14 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $9 million decrease in restructuring charges and a reduction of costs as the Company continues to optimize its global real estate footprint.\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets increased $1 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year period.\n\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets was similar to the prior year period.\n\nOther general expenses decreased $4 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $47 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $9 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and the preemptive reduction and deferral of certain discretionary expenses, partially offset by $18 million of transaction costs related to the pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, $7 million of costs related to move of the jurisdiction for the firm's parent company to Ireland, and an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth.\n\nFIRST QUARTER 2020 INCOME SUMMARY\n\nThe first quarter 2020 financial results discussed herein represent performance from continuing operations unless otherwise noted. In addition, certain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, which are also described in detail in \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings Per Share\" on page 10 of this press release.\n\nThree Months EndedMarch 31,\n\n(millions)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n% Change\n\nRevenue\n\n$\n\n3,219\n\n$\n\n3,143\n\n2%\n\nExpenses\n\n2,186\n\n2,271\n\n(4)\n\nOperating income\n\n$\n\n1,033\n\n$\n\n872\n\n18%\n\nOperating margin\n\n32.1%\n\n27.7%\n\nOperating income - as adjusted\n\n$\n\n1,148\n\n$\n\n1,060\n\n8%\n\nOperating margin - as adjusted\n\n35.7%\n\n33.7%\n\nOperating income increased to $1,033 million compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for certain items detailed on page 10 of this press release, operating income increased $88 million, or 8%, and operating margin increased +200 basis points to 35.7%, each compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating income and margin primarily reflect strong organic revenue growth of 5%, increased operating leverage across the portfolio, and the preemptive reduction and deferral of certain discretionary expenses, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $10 million.\n\nInterest income was $2 million, similar to the prior year period. Interest expense increased $11 million to $83 million compared to the prior year period reflecting higher outstanding term debt and an increase in commercial paper borrowings. Other pension income was $4 million, similar to the prior year period. Other income of $25 million primarily reflects a gain on sale of a certain business and net gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.\n\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nNet loss from discontinued operations was $1 million compared to $0 million in the prior year period.\n\nConference Call, Presentation Slides and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, May 1, 2020 at 7:30 a.m., central time.

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of Aon's operations, the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, and Aon's pending combination with Willis Towers Watson (the \"Combination\"). All statements, other than statements of historical facts that address activities, events or developments that Aon expects or anticipates may occur in the future, including such things as its outlook, future capital expenditures, growth in commissions and fees, changes to the composition or level of its revenues, cash flow and liquidity, expected tax rates, business strategies, competitive strengths, goals, the benefits of new initiatives, growth of its business and operations, plans and references to future successes, are forward-looking statements. Also, when Aon uses the words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"potential\", \"looking forward\", or similar expressions, it is making forward-looking statements.\n\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements: general economic and political conditions in different countries in which Aon does business around the world, including the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union; changes in the competitive environment or damage to Aon's reputation; fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could influence revenue and expenses; changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets; changes in the funding status of Aon's various defined benefit pension plans and the impact of any increased pension funding resulting from those changes; the level of Aon's debt limiting financial flexibility or increasing borrowing costs; rating agency actions that could affect Aon's ability to borrow funds; volatility in Aon's tax rate due to a variety of different factors, including U.S. tax reform; changes in estimates or assumptions on Aon's financial statements; limits on Aon's subsidiaries to make dividend and other payments to Aon; the impact of lawsuits and other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies arising from errors and omissions and other claims against Aon; the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which Aon operates, particularly given the global scope of Aon's businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which Aon does business; the impact of any investigations brought by regulatory authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries; the impact of any inquiries relating to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and with U.S. and non-U.S. trade sanctions regimes; failure to protect intellectual property rights or allegations that Aon infringes on the intellectual property rights of others; the effects of Irish law on Aon's operating flexibility and the enforcement of judgments against Aon; the failure to retain and attract qualified personnel; international risks associated with Aon's global operations; the effects of natural or man-made disasters, including the effects of COVID-19 and other health pandemics; the potential of a system or network breach or disruption resulting in operational interruption or improper disclosure of personal data; Aon's ability to develop and implement new technology; the damage to Aon's reputation among clients, markets or third parties; the actions taken by third parties that perform aspects of Aon's business operations and client services; the extent to which Aon manages certain risks created in connection with the services, including fiduciary and investments, consulting, and other advisory services, among others, that Aon currently provides, or will provide in the future, to clients; Aon's ability to continue, and the costs and the costs and risks associated with, growing, developing and integrating companies that it acquires or new lines of business; changes in commercial property and casualty markets, commercial premium rates or methods of compensation; changes in the health care system or Aon's relationships with insurance carriers; Aon's ability to implement initiatives intended to yield cost savings, and the ability to achieve those cost savings; Aon's ability to realize the expected benefits from its restructuring plan; the possibility that the Combination will not be consummated; failure to obtain necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the Combination; adverse effects on the market price of Aon's securities and/or operating results for any reason, including, without limitation, because of the failure to consummate the Combination; the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Combination (including anticipated revenue and growth synergies); the failure to effectively integrate the combined companies following the Combination; significant transaction and integration costs or difficulties in connection with the Combination and or unknown or inestimable liabilities; potential litigation associated with the Combination; potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the Combination on relationships, including with suppliers, customers, employees and regulators; and general economic, business and political conditions (including any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak, including COVID-19) that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the Combination.\n\nAny or all of Aon's forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about Aon's performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 or any future period, particularly in light of the continuing effect of the COVID-19 outbreak. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon's financial results, is contained in Aon's filings with the SEC. See Aon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports. Aon is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nThis communication includes supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization, restructuring, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. The impact of foreign exchange is determined by translating last year's revenue, expense, or net income at this year's foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The effective tax rate, as adjusted, excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization, restructuring, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.\n\nCurrency impact is determined by translating last year's revenue at this year's foreign exchange rates.\n\n(2)\n\nFiduciary investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $15 million and $19 million, respectively.\n\n(3)\n\nOrganic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.\n\nFree Cash Flows from Operations (Unaudited)\n\nThree Months EndedMarch 31,\n\n(millions)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n% Change\n\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\n\n$\n\n338\n\n$\n\n74\n\n357%\n\nCapital Expenditures Used for Operations\n\n(59)\n\n(57)\n\n4\n\nFree Cash Flows Provided by Operations (1)\n\n$\n\n279\n\n$\n\n17\n\n1,541%\n\n(1)\n\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures.

Having understood the importance of digital currency technology, the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate has awarded a grant of $199,000 to Factom Inc.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s recent press release states that the organization has issued the grant to Factom to facilitate the development of digital identity security for Internet of Things devices. The Austin, Texas-based Factom is one of the companies to submit the proposal for the Silicon Valley Innovation Program – Other Transaction Solicitation late last year. The company’s proposal titled “Blockchain Software to prove Integrity of Captured Data from Border Devices” was selected and in turn awarded the grant under Securing the Internet of Things (IoT), Solicitation Number: HSHQDC-16-R-00035.\n\nInternet of Things is the latest technology fad, which deals with the concept of connected devices These devices connected over the internet can constantly exchange data with each other. The constant data exchange combined with some form of automation will impart a certain degree of autonomy to these IoT devices. The gradual increase in IoT devices calls for focus on its security as well, and the Department of Homeland Security’s initiative is targeted towards finding such security solutions for the IoT-based devices that are part of its infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Factom’s proposal, the company will leverage the blockchain technology to authenticate devices. Authentication will prevent unauthorized access by device spoofing, ensuring the integrity of data. With all the relevant details about the device already registered on the blockchain, it is virtually impossible or anyone to alter the past equipment data and spoof device identity.\n\nBlockchain is an important element in the Internet of Things revolution, no thanks to the Department of Homeland Security. The blockchain network, with its smart contracts, makes the whole process of automation easier. It will also help in both information and value exchange. There are prototype IoT devices currently being experimented by different groups. we can expect it to become mainstream in the coming years,\n\nThe company Factom is already involved in one such project where the company is working on a smart city project in China. The company already has enough expertise to execute the Department of Homeland Security’s project. However, there is no fixed timeline available at the moment and it is also not sure whether the department is keen on adoption open source solutions.\n\nNewsBTC is a news service that covers bitcoin news, technical analysis & forecasts for bitcoin and other altcoins.

{"text": "Zhang Yimou's tour through film genres (historical epic, action thriller, psychological thriller, costume drama, country tale, and epic melodrama) has now reached the gangster film. Mob-ruled Shanghai in the 1930's is the setting for the first half of Shanghai Triad [Yao ya yao, yao dao waipo qiao]. Zhang displays a swirl of luxury, violence (although muted), glamorous production numbers (featuring Gong Li), and claustrophobic menace. It's certainly stylish, but doesn't break new ground. What we have instead is a setup for the second half of the film: the main characters (gangster boss Tang (Li Baotian), his mistress Jinbao (Gong Li), who is a famous nightclub singer, and her new boy servant Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao)) retreat to a remote, peaceful island, where the consequences of the first part are played out. The film ends with a return to Shanghai.\n\nLike all of Zhang Yimou's work, this film supports a wealth of possible meanings. As allegory, we have once again a vision of how innocent victims of an all-powerful patriarchal figure (embodied in the gang boss) attempt to survive under its shadow.\n\nUsing a slightly narrower focus, one can find a commentary on contemporary post-Communist China. Some historians see a striking similarity between China's current embrace of gung-ho capitalism and its attendant corruption on the one hand, and the free-wheeling commercialism and lawlessness of pre-revolutionary Shanghai on the other. So perhaps the film is a standard cautionary tale, depicting the perils of China's current condition. In this rather literal-minded reading, Boss Tang and his aging cronies could stand for the progressively more enfeebled Chinese leadership of today, brutally wielding power not out of any ideological fervour, but merely in the pursuit of wealth. (1)\n\nShanghai Triad can also be seen as another showpiece for Gong Li: crafted this time to display her in a sophisticated, international setting. She wears glamorous clothing -- she sings, she dances -- she's given a charismatic character who makes the journey from an extremely unsympathetic character to someone we end up caring for. It's a great, meaty role, but I'm not sure Gong Li pulls it off, this time. She doesn't seem completely to mesh with the character of Jinbao. I'm reminded of what is lacking in some of her Hong Kong film performances: there is a distance, a slightly uncomfortable fit, which never lets one forget that we're watching China's Most Celebrated Movie Star. And I'm afraid that I would have to agree with nightclub patron \"Fatty Yu\", who observes of Jinbao's stage performace that \"she looks better than she sings\".\n\nUnfortunately, the film's text (story, screenplay and characterization) doesn't feel substantial enough to support the burden of all its subtexts, of all the cultural work that it is trying to perform. To Live (1994) hinted at a new problem in Zhang's work: the allegorical \"point\" of that movie -- that the intervention of the Chinese Communist Party into history meant only disaster for the Chinese -- threatened to overwhelm the particularity of its story.\n\nZhang's earlier films Red Sorghum (1987), Judou (1989), Raise the Red Lantern (1991) and The Story of Qiu Ju (1992) all pack a tremendous emotional punch. Each of their stories is self-sufficient. The affective investment that each inspires can then animate the other registers of meaning (what Fredric Jameson calls \"allegorical transcodings\") that each generates. But this process does not work well in reverse. Shanghai Triad relies too heavily on the strength of its extra-textual references to support its otherwise thinly drawn story.

For more interesting, nuanced explorations of the corrosive results of Dengism's \"to get rich is glorious\", see Zhou Xiaowen's Ermo (1994), and Huang Jianxin's Signal Left, Turn Right (1996), to name just a couple of recent examples.(back to article)\n\n(2) This issue continues to dog the latest films from the mailand. Zhou Xiaowen's The Emperor's Shadow (1996) is a lavishly drawn, epically scaled history of the tyrannical Qin Emperor Ying Zheng, his dependence on his court musician Gao Jianli, and the latter's refusal to put his own art at the service of imperial power. It is no surprise that this very dilemma should preoccupy a film director still trying to work within the PRC film system. In this case, though, it exerts an almost palpable pressure on the film that manages to smother its vitality.\n\nJust the opposite is true for independent filmmaker Zhang Yuan's stunningly successful Sons (1996), a precisely imagined and rivetingly intense family drama/documentary set in contemporary Beijing. In it, two indolent sons burdened by an alcoholic, abusive, and increasingly loony father finally free themselves from his domination: one son strikes him, and the resulting shock drives Dad meekly into a mental hospital. The apparently true origin of this plot lightens the film's burden of allegorical signification (though it's not all that hard to construct one, in retropect), and frees the story to work entirely on its own terms.\n\nfor the rest of the article, refer to the current issue of Cineaction (No. 42, Spring, 1997).", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Therapeutic strategies for pigmented purpuric dermatoses: a systematic literature review.\nPigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) is a group of diseases with distinguishing clinical characteristics, characterized mainly by purpuric skin lesions. The course of PPDs is chronic and recurrences are common. Although PPDs are considered to be benign, the associated symptoms, such as pruritus, and their cosmetic effect can be extremely distressing to patients. So far no evidence-based treatment has been found to be drastically effective in a large scale of patients. This paper is a systematic overview of all the reported successful treatments described in the literature. Articles derived from the databases PubMed and SCOPUS and published between 1990 and 2018, were analyzed for this review. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA Guidelines. In the literature there are several case series and case reports, demonstrating encouraging results with the use of various agents, such as local calcineurin-inhibitors, colchicine, pentoxifylline, immunosuppresants, UV- and Laser-therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on the therapeutic strategies for pigmented purpuric dermatoses. This paper aims to raise awareness for the need to conduct larger systematic studies in order to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the above mentioned therapeutic strategies.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Plant biomass and productivity of many ecosystems are limited by the availability of reactive nitrogen, this is reduced or oxidized forms of N. Over the last century synthetic N fertilizers have undoubtedly helped to enhance crop yields, thus allowing an unprecedented growth of the world population. Despite this, nearly 80% of N fertilizer applied to crops does not reach human mouths but is lost to the environment in water run-off from fields, animal waste, and gas emissions. This N fertilizer abuse, particularly in rich countries, has strongly perturbed the biogeochemical N cycle with an unprecedented production and accumulation of reactive N in the biosphere that threatens human health and ecosystems biodiversity, and contributes to climate change. Optimizing N use and minimizing its negative impacts is a major challenge for the next decades (Galloway et al., [@B1]).\n\nMicrobes (bacteria and fungi) are main protagonists of all the major reactions in the N-cycle. Microbial activities that process nitrogen in soils and sediments are complex and highly challenging. Better understanding of these processes is important for improving the efficiency of agricultural practices that are essential for food production and environmental quality across the globe. Therefore, any technologies aiming at reducing the N problem must recognize the roles and potential applications of these N-cycle microbes, from diazotrophs to denitrifiers. These microbiotechnologies are necessary if we want to bring reactive N levels back within planet safety boundaries while ensuring crop productivity and food security (Steffen et al., [@B3]).\n\nThis Research Topic focused on the biotechnology of microbes and microbial processes which can directly or indirectly contribute to alleviate the N problem at local and/or global scales. Fifteen of 20 submitted manuscripts have been accepted for publication.\n\nFive articles dealt with various aspects of nitrogenase and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), the key bacterial process that converts atmospheric N~2~ into reactive nitrogen accessible for living organisms. Three papers were on the nitrogen fixing symbioses between legume plants and soil rhizobia. [Temprano-Vera et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02843) analyzed differences among *Sinorhizobium fredii* strains at nodulating various genotypes of *Glycine max* (soybean, the most widely produced legume) and *Glycine soja* (the wild ancestor of soybeans). Their results illustrate the complexity of genetic determinants of the soybean-rhizobia compatibility. Also concerning soybeans, [Fernández et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00924) reported the importance of adaptation of the soybean symbiont *Bradyrhizobium japonicum* to microxic conditions for efficient nitrogen fixation, and identified novel genes subjected to posttranscriptional regulation during microxia which are important for symbiosis. [Tsyganov et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00015) reported on the contribution of a legume nitrogen-fixing symbiosis to the plant tolerance to Cd, as well as its potential applications for phytoremediation and phytostabilization of soils with high Cd contents. Two other studies identified novel functions which are important for optimal nitrogen fixation in free-living diazotrophs, and therefore should be considered in current and future studies aiming at obtaining nitrogen-fixing plants by genetic engineering. [Navarro-Rodríguez et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00579) reported on the importance of the molybdenum storage protein MoSto for nitrogen fixation by *Azotobacter vinelandii* under Mo-limiting conditions. On another hand, [Nonaka et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00495) described the essentiality of several proteins required for nitrogenase assembly during diazotrophic growth by the cyanobacterium *Leptolyngbya boryana*.\n\nAnother key process in the N cycle is denitrification, which has a strong impact in the environment through the production of reactive nitric oxide (NO) and the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N~2~O), with a strong potential to drive climate change. [Olaya-Abril et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01137) have explored this process in *Paracoccus denitrificans* PD1222 through a quantitative proteomic analysis and have established key features of the denitrification metabolism, particularly the induction of enzymes of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, together with enzymes that synthesize acetyl-CoA. On another hand, [Liu B. et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03208) have monitored the kinetics of denitrification gene expression and NO, N~2~O, and N~2~ production in soils exposed to microxia. They concluded that regulatory strategies observed in individual isolates are also displayed in complex communities, emphasizing the need for successive sampling when identifying active key organisms. Two other manuscripts showed that in addition to denitrification, other microbial processes such as nitrate assimilation can be sources of NO and N~2~O. [Ruiz et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01526) reported that the pathway involving the assimilatory nitrate (NarB) and nitrite (NirB) reductases indirectly contribute to NO synthesis by cooperating with the denitrification pathway in *Sinorhizobium meliloti*. [Hidalgo-García et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00980) demonstrated that in addition to its involvement in nitrate assimilation, NarB is also required for NO and N~2~O production in *Rhizobium etli*. Nitrite produced by NarB from assimilatory nitrate reduction is detoxified by NirK and cNor denitrifying enzymes that convert nitrite into NO which in turn is reduced to N~2~O, respectively.\n\nNitrification linked to denitrification constitutes an important biotic source of N~2~O emissions from soils. The aerobic oxidation of ammonia (NH~3~) to nitrite ($\\text{NO}_{2}^{-}$) is carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or archaea (AOA) that also possess the enzymatic pathway to reduce $\\text{NO}_{2}^{-}$ to N~2~O (Hu et al., [@B2]). In this regard, the changes in the microbial communities and N~2~O emissions due to common soil management practices were investigated in various papers. The impact of urea fertilization on the nitrifier microbial populations was evaluated by [Staley et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00634) in eight contrasting agricultural soil types. Their results indicate that while bacterial and archeal diversity is negatively affected, high urea applications favor particular strains or species of nitrifying genera such as *Nitrobacter, Nitrospira*, and *Nitrosospira*, regardless the soil type. In the same line, [Lourenço et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00674) reported that soil amendments with organic vinasses and inorganic N fertilizer lead to increased N~2~O emissions which correlate with enhanced abundance of AOB, particularly *Nitrosospira*. On another hand, [Fang et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02529) reported that application of dazomet, a microbicide used to control soil pathogens, causes reversible changes in bacterial community compositions and reduces the abundance of N-cycle functional genes, however N~2~O production rates increased in correlation with NH~3~, dissolved amino acids and microbial biomass nitrogen contents. [Tomasek et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02304) provided evidence that inundation drives shifts in both the microbial community and the denitrification rates, suggesting that approaches such as periodic flooding can be an effective management strategy to remediate nitrate pollution. Finally, [Black and Just](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02061) reported the influence that river mussels communities have on the abundance of N-cycling microbial species. Mussels filtration and biodeposition determine a sediment habitat that favors the mixotrophic coexistence of nitrite-oxidizing (NOB) and ammonia-oxiding (comammox) *Nitrospira* species, what impacts N-cycling in river backwaters. Another important group of microorganisms that play a significant role in the N cycle are AOA. [Liu L. et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00875) explored a new strategy for the rapid enrichment of high abundance *Nitrosocosmicus*-like AOA from soil, providing a new solution to the enrichment and cultivation of AOA in short periods.\n\nIn summary, these articles have brought novel knowledge on the diversity, genetics, and physiology of microbes from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that participate in the N cycle. Potential applications of this knowledge can be envisaged that will contribute to alleviate the nitrogen problem to achieve a healthier planet and a sustainable food production.\n\nAuthor Contributions {#s1}\n====================\n\nJS initiated the Research Topic and invited editors MD and LG.

{"text": "Efficacy, safety, and risk-benefit analysis of adjuvant interferon alfa-2b in melanoma.\nA recently completed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial, E1684, has shown that adjuvant therapy with high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2b (rIFN-alpha 2b) has a significant impact on relapse-free and overall survival in melanoma patients at high risk of recurrence. Adjuvant rIFN-alpha 2b increased the median overall survival to 3.82 years in the treatment group compared with 2.78 years with observation and yielded a 5-year survival rate of 46% versus 37% with observation. This is the first adjuvant therapy to significantly extend survival in this patient population (P = .0023, one-sided). The response to therapy was greatest among those patients with clinical evidence of nodal metastasis. The toxicity associated with this regimen was substantial but tolerable. Approximately 78% of patients treated with rIFN-alpha 2b experienced grade 3 or greater toxicity, and dose modifications were required for 37% and 36% of patients in the induction or maintenance phase, respectively. Quality-of-life-adjusted survival analysis has shown that, despite the toxicity associated with rIFN-alpha 2b therapy, the quality-of-life-adjusted time gained with rIFN-alpha 2b therapy outweighs the reduced quality of life associated with treatment toxicity and relapse. These data support the use of high-dose rIFN-alpha 2b as adjuvant therapy in melanoma patients at high risk of recurrence.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Since I’m pretty much still in recovery mode after a busy weekend, I thought it was maybe a good time to share my (pretty long overdue) post about Newcastle’s latest offering on the pubs and clubs, and the place where I’ve started to find myself most Friday nights: MSA (Music Slash Art). Usually in the company of Miss Archer and Miss Bosson. A relative newbie in the Toon, most people will remember MSA as one of the many trampy trebles bars from their uni days, Bar 42. However, after being acquired by the guys behind Unit 44, it’s undergone a complete overhaul. Take some leather sofas, a few leather booths and a few custom carved tables, and an eclectic art collection, and all of a sudden you’ve transformed what used to be a total dive, into Newcastle’s latest hotspot. Gone are the two quid trebles in favour of a cocktail list to rival Alvinos. Of course they serve up all the classics, but if you’re feeling adventurous then you can try out one of their more unusual offerings like the popcorn martini. (Although it’s worth adding a disclaimer that this one is only for those with a VERY sweet tooth, as Miss Bosson found out). I decided to play it (fairly) safe though with the MSA margarita, made with Patron tequila so guaranteed to make you feel as though you belong in some kind of R&B or rap video.. or on The Hills.\n\nWith its mix of music that’s guaranteed to get you on your feet, it’s become a kind of go-to place that you know isn’t going to be full of idiots. The revamp it’s undergone since falling into the hands of Danny and Steven is a thing to behold.. gone are the sticky floors of 42s in favour of trendy art and custom carved wooden tables. Every time I go, I feel as though I spot something different. Whether you’re looking for somewhere to let loose on the dancefloor, or sit in a corner sipping your drink and looking cool, MSA is definitely the place to tick those boxes. Sitting somewhere between a bar and a club, it’s the sort of place you can go if you fancy a bit of a dance and want to stay out late, but can’t really be bothered with the hustle and bustle of a club.

For dessert, check out the world's largest chocolate fountain by Jean-Phillipe.\n\nOutros posts interessantes:\n\nThere is also a very nice bar bordering the sports books where you can celebrate your latest win. Craps There were 12 craps tables all centered along the main hallway of the casino. From late September until Thanksgiving weekend the Conservatory puts on its Autumn ceremony featuring several varieties of chrysanthemum and several large pumpkins. I would venture to say so as to this is probably the busiest casino on the Strip, after that it feels like that at any time you gamble there.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI would rate the Casino itself as first class, but I think the staff is not particularly friendly, with a bit of snootiness and attitude. Contrary to urban myth, the lagoon is not filled with treated greywater from the hotel. Because of the size of the property, some rooms are a trek from the lobby after that restaurants. All have sophisticated, contemporary decor, but it varies amid room categories. A single act may be skipped to avert interference with a planned event. At Bellagio, elegantly appointed accommodations pair modern conveniences with the warmth of home, featuring sweeping vistas of the resort's lagoon, surrounding mountains and Las Vegas skyline. Conservatory and botanical gardens[ edit ] A summer ceremony Conservatory The hotel also contains a Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. Summary The Bellagio casino is indeed a jewel at the middle of the Las Vegas strip. You won't find everywhere to sit, unless it's all the rage front of a slot android or at a restaurant.\n\nJogar golfe\n\nThis hallway, from the opulent mall that leads to Ballys after that Caesars Palace, to the apply pressure and Conservatory, is very a great deal travelled. There is also a desk workstation with high-speed internet access and a multi-line call. Bellagio's restaurants run the gamut from gourmet Five Diamond en route for casual dining. I do not know how much value of the Holiday Gift Shoppe points add. All rooms have marble bathrooms with double sinks, drench tubs , and separate beaker showers. To begin with, there are five outdoor swimming pools in a stunning Mediterranean-style courtyard with elaborate sculptures. Behind a set of curtains in so as to room is Club Prive, which features a very classy botequim featuring rare spirits and add baccarat and blackjack tables. Table games line most of the hallway from the entrance of the casino to the end of the pathway, which is the hotel lobby and Conservatory. See musical fountain.\n\nAdditional shows can occur for distinctive occasions including weddings. Blackjack tables were absolutely terrible for us and the craps tables were not much better. The motif is art deco and there is a raised floor after that dark wood. Located in the Spa Tower, these rooms agreement beautiful vistas of the celebrated Las Vegas Strip, with the Fountains of Bellagio also all the rage view.

The top is silver plated and the the body is cut crystal.\n\nYou may have seen sugar castors at thrift shops and yard sales and not been sure what they are used for. They are intended to sprinkle caster sugar on pastries, berries, etc. at the dinner table.\n\nThe detachable top is perforated to allow for easy sprinkling of the finely powdered caster sugar.\n\nI'm not making typos here when I say castor for the shaker and caster for the sugar. The shaker gets it's name from castor sets that graced dining tables and usually held oil and vinegar bottles, mustard pots, salt and pepper shakers and sugar castors. No Victorian dining table would be complete without one of these beauties.\n\nCaster sugar is finely ground, white sugar and is sometimes called confectioner's sugar. Because it is finely ground, it dissolves quickly and is often used in meringues and perfect for adding sweetness to desserts at the table without the grittiness of regular table sugar. I'm not saying this stuff is good for you, just that it's gooood!\n\nIn fact, caster sugar is so good I may have been a little heavy handed when I dusted these lemon squares.\n\nEven we healthy eating gals have to have the odd guilty splurge, don't you think?I'm sharing this with What's It Wednesday\n\nThursday, 23 April 2015\n\nEarth Day 2015 is over. I've turned out the lights for an hour this evening and read all the nice Facebook slogans. It should feel good, but it doesn't. I know in my heart that we are failing the planet, everything that lives on it and everything that will inhabit the world in the future.\n\nWe simply aren't doing enough, though we have ample evidence that we are on a rapidly escalating path to destruction.\n\nI'm a normal human being and I don't want to give up all the convenience of our modern world. I like heat, hydro, cars and all the rest of the things that consume fossil fuel. I buy lumber and wood products. In short I use it all and, even if I do my best to keep my consumption and my carbon footprint low, I'm still part of the problem.\n\nBut, I also believe that there are clever people out there who know how to make changes that will allow us to keep much of our standard of living and still give the earth the chance to heal. There are amazing inventions that never get to see the light of day and the only reason they aren't being integrated into our world is GREED. Greed of governments (and Canada is a top offender here), that want the corporate taxes and economic growth from the fossil fuel industry and greed of corporations that have no reason for existence except to generate profit. In Canada, we are afraid of our economy collapsing if we move away from exploiting and exporting our natural resources. We choose to do this in our boreal forest. ~\n\nphoto credit Jiri Rezak\n\nThis is a tar sands, oil extraction project in Alberta, Canada. It is a complex means of extracting oil from sand that creates enormous lakes of toxins, right in the middle of the boreal forest. That forest is 54% of the world's intact boreal and crucial to migrating birds, water flow to the Arctic Ocean to form ice and cool the atmosphere and it's wetlands store 25 yrs. of man made carbon emissions. Canada has 10,000 kilometers of boreal forest. That's equal to the Amazon forest and just as important to world ecology.\n\nIf you are upset at finding out how poorly we are caring for this world resource, I'll give you a hint on how to put pressure on Canadians to treat this forest with the respect it deserves.\n\nWe Canadians have a great point of vulnerability; our Achilles heel as it were. We are vain about our public image. That's all you need to know to put pressure on us. We like to be thought of as the good guys, home to moose and beaver, with beautiful lakes and mountains and forests and people who say sorry even when they haven't done anything to be sorry about.\n\nJust imagine how many times we are going to be saying sorry if the world starts exposing us as one of the lowest performers in the OECD on working toward halting climate change.\n\nSend your journalists over here and let them show what a tar sands trailing pond looks like. Let them write about how these ponds are leaking chemicals into a delicate northern ecosystem. ~\n\nYou know I like to write about positive things and stories with happy endings. It is painful to me to say bad things about the country that I have always felt blessed to live in. Only my absolute belief that mankind has reached a crisis on environmental issues would induce me to write this post.\n\nIt is all connected; all of us and everything in this world. Each thing we do impacts everything else and everyone else around us. It ripples and moves and touches another thing. I want to move away from doing bad things and begin to move toward doing good things.\n\nIt's time to truly understand planet Earth. The sand in the hourglass is sifting through to the bottom. Let's support the new thinkers that can help us turn the hourglass around.\n\nI was amazed and delighted to see this video of the research discovery of the symbiotic relationship between species and generations of trees and fungi. It's only 4 minutes long and worth the time to get a good idea of how much we have yet to learn about how things connect in the world.\n\nI know our hearts are in the right place and maybe next year I can post about all the wonderful progress we have made and say,\n\nThursday, 16 April 2015\n\nOne of the things you have to be careful about in chicken care is controlling lice and mites on the birds. No matter how clean you keep the coop, wild birds will carry these pests to your flock. The standard procedure is to dust the coop and chickens with Diatomaceous Earth. Lice and mites can weaken a bird by feeding on it, so it's important to keep these pests under control.\n\nYou see it here as the white powder sprinkled throughout the hay in my newly cleaned coop. ~\n\nI wasn't about to start dowsing my girls with this stuff without doing some heavy duty research first. What I discovered was a natural insect control product that can be used not only in the coop, but in the vegetable and flower gardens and inside my home.\n\nWhat is it? It is the fossilized remains of aquatic organisms called diatoms. They accumulated in the silt of waterways and is mined from those sites since the 1800's. Crushed into a fine powder, it has uses for a drying or binding agent and to control insect infestations. It's in many of the bug control products marketed for garden use.\n\nIt comes in various grades and I want to be absolutely clear that I am only talking about food grade certified Diatomaceous. I'm saying it twice, only use certified food grade diatomaceous earth. Let's make that three times. It's food grade that is safe for you, your children, and your pets.\n\nHere's how it works. When insects crawl over the powdered Diatomaceous Earth, the sharp particles damage their exoskeleton. This allows the powder to enter the insect and dehydrate it.\n\nIt does not hurt creatures that do not have an exoskeleton, even if it is consumed orally. This makes it an ideal pest control product for inside the home. Sprinkled in areas where there is a problem with fleas, ticks, spiders, ants, bedbugs etc. it will kill all the bugs passing over it.\n\nIn the case of pet flea control, carpets, pet beds and furniture can be sprinkled with the powder and it can be sprinkled on the fur of the pet. It doesn't hurt your cat or dog to lick the powder off. I've used it with no ill effect on my cats. The only downside was the cats dragging the powder from the carpets to the rest of the house. I admit it was a nightmare of white paw prints that had to be cleaned off every surface they could manage to tromp all over! In my opinion, it was worth the mess to avoid putting chemicals on or in the cats to get rid of the fleas.\n\nAfter about a week, the new flea eggs will have hatched and the process has to be done all over again.\n\nI also leave a fine dusting of Diatomaceous Earth in the basement to kill spiders and centipedes.\n\nPots of herbs and weather sensitive plants that are brought indoors to overwinter should have a dusting of it on the pot soil to be sure you aren't importing bugs into the house.\n\nIt's the only product I use in my vegetable garden and flower beds now. Since it is food grade and I can actually eat the stuff with no ill effects, I'm comfortable putting it on my vegetable plants when there is a bug problem and still have organic produce.\n\nWhat does it cost? I find the price fluctuates wildly depending on the retailer. Garden centres sell a small canister or bag for around $8.00. I've seen stores specialising in organic and natural insect control charging over $60.00 for a 50 lb bag. I bought my 50 lb. bag at my local feed mill for $8.00 so do some price shopping in your area. Once you've determined it's food grade, you don't need any pretty packaging or chic labels to get the job done safely and quickly. I've been using the same 50 lb. bag for three years, have given tubs of it away and still have three-quarters of it left.\n\nHow do you use it? I use a mask while I'm sprinkling the dust so I'm not breathing in the fine powder. Any powder, inhaled, can be an irritant to lungs, sinus and throat. It is a drying agent and can irritate eyes so protective glasses are a good idea. For the same reason, I don't sprinkle it near pet's eyes or mouths.\nIt's recommended you leave it on surfaces in the home for four to twelve hours before vacuuming it up. I left it on my carpets for several days to be sure every flea had ample time to crawl over it.\nIt should only be sprinkled on dry surfaces. Dampness reduces the effectiveness of the powder and I find it solidifies into a bit of a paste if it gets wet that is difficult to clean up.\nI sprinkle the powder on days when the windows are closed and no fans are running so it isn't stirred up into the air, causing potential breathing problems.\nIt only takes a thin layer of the dust to be effective. If you apply it too thickly to surfaces, it may cause clogging of your vacuum. I've never had a problem but somewhere I read that caution.\nI sprinkle it on the floor, nesting boxes and perches of the coop. Once a month or so, I add a bit to the chicken feeders for a natural dewormer.\n\nThere you go. No more dangerous chemicals, low cost, earth friendly and your bug troubles are gone!\n\nSunday, 12 April 2015\n\nWarm weather is here! It reached 19 degrees celsius (66 F) today and I could hardly make myself take the time to gulp down a cup of coffee before I hit the great outdoors.\n\nThe chickens were just as anxious to 'fly the coop'. Once again, they made me laugh at how much they act like us. Like any good Canadian, they couldn't wait to leave the main coop and go to the quarantine coop cottage.\n\nThe little coop is barely big enough to hold 2 chickens comfortably, but they all crowded in. It has no amenities, no waterer or feeder, or straw lined nesting boxes. It's a rustic cedar cottage and they had the time of their lives in there. I would call them silly chickens, but I've squashed my family into a cedar shack, that had very few amenities, many a time and called it our vacation.Since they were on holiday, they did a little sunning and bathing. ~\n\nNothing is finer on a sunny, spring day than to head for the woods on a hike, with a pickup picnic lunch. ~\n\nTheir personalities are as different as you find in any family. Rukmini, on the right, is bossy and pushes her sisters out of the way to grab the best bugs. Maddy, on the left, is shy and a bit on the sneaky side. In the middle is Elizabeth. She is polite and very particular about keeping her feathers snowy white. The queen of the flock, Kay, is at the back, leading the way into certain trouble as she takes them to the neighbours yard. Old Vivien isn't in the picture because she always keeps her distance from the rowdy youngsters. She's a rescue and even leary of me; never sure if fate will turn on her again and have her scheduled to be culled out.\n\nOf course, I wasn't on holiday and it was a perfect time to do a spring cleaning on the main coop. All this winter bedding and poop had to come out. ~\n\nA scrub down and some fresh straw makes it good as new for when they come home from their vacation. ~\n\nLast, but not least, I put Kay's baby back in the nursery. It may look like a golf ball to you and I, but to her it is a beloved child. As much as she screams and carries on while she lays an egg, she doesn't have any attachment to it. The other chickens can sit on it and anybody can take it away without bothering her in the least. But, don't even think of touching her baby! She'll puff herself up and pace up and down the coop, hollering bloody murder until you put it back.\n\nTuesday, 7 April 2015\n\nIf we can ever get it to stop snowing here it will be yard sale season. Yes, it snowed in Ontario over the Easter weekend, but it has to warm up sooner or later. Doesn't it?\n\nIf you are lucky enough to have warm weather, here's something to look for at yard sales. I have a fondness for glass milk bottles and actually transfer my milk to one. It stays so much colder in glass bottles.\n\nI also have a fondness for ladles and would have bought this little one even if I didn't know what it was. A friend had shown me hers and I recognized this as a ladle to skim the cream from milk in glass bottles.\n\nIt has Cream Top embossed on the handle and a patent date of 1924. Canadian patents registered before 1989 were good for 17 years so I can date this ladle pretty closely.\n\nSince I had the ladle, the friend found a cream top bottle to go along with it for me. The cream would rise to the top of the bottle and you could either stir it into the milk or skim it off for coffee cream, heavy cream or whipping cream. This bottle shape kept the cream nicely in the bubble on top. Oh, how I wish you could buy milk like that today!\n\nAll I needed was a paper top and this little bit of daily life from the past was complete.\n\nI paid $6.00 for my ladle at an antique show, but if you know what you are looking for you will come across one for much less at thrift stores and yard sales.\n\nHappy hunting and keep your fingers crossed for me that the weather starts to feel like spring soon!", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Intensive practical lifestyle intervention improves endothelial function in metabolic syndrome independent of weight loss: a randomized controlled trial.\nThe objective was to evaluate the metabolic and vascular effects of lifestyle interventions involving a healthy diet and either a moderate- or a high-intensity exercise regimen in nondiabetic subjects with metabolic syndrome. The effects of these interventions on flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and risk profiles were compared with a standard low-fat diet and engaging in daily walking (standard of care). Seventy-five healthy adults with metabolic syndrome (30-55 years old) were randomized to a 10,000-steps-a-day exercise program, a 3-times-a-week fitness (>75% peak VO(2)) program, or a 1-hour-walking-a-day program for 12 weeks. The first 2 interventions were combined with an accessible healthy, no-sugar diet; and the third was combined with a tailored low-fat diet. The outcomes, including FMD and risk factors, were examined at 12 weeks and at 1-year reassessment. Significant increase in FMD (mean difference = 1.51%, 95% confidence interval = 1.05%-3.017%, P = .0007) and decrease in arterial pressure (mean difference = 19.3 ± 2.3/-12.6 ± 1.8 mm Hg, P = .0001) were observed in all groups. However, the FMD changed most favorably in the high-intensity, low-sugar group (mean difference = 1.56%, 95% confidence interval = 0.1%-3.02%, P = .036). Significant improvements in body mass index, waist, insulin-like growth factor-1, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin, glucose, urinary albumin excretion, and lipid profiles occurred in all groups. Metabolic syndrome was resolved in 64%. One year later, weight loss (-9.1 ± 2.3 kg, P = .0001) and arterial pressure decrease (-18.5 ± 2.3/-12.3 ± 2.1 mm Hg, P = .0001) were maintained. Practical, health-centered diet combined with high-intensity exercise is associated with enhanced vascular protection. These data suggest that more intense exercise combined with a low-sugar diet modulates endothelium-dependent vasodilation.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "The size, location, and clinical severity of corneal infiltrative events associated with contact lens wear.\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the size, location, and clinical severity of corneal infiltrative events (CIEs) associated with contact lens wear. We examined a series of contact lens wearers, presenting consecutively to a large hospital clinic, who had any form of CIE. The severity of the CIE was quantified using a clinical severity matrix based on scores attributed to each of 10 signs and symptoms. The infiltrate was accurately drawn on a schematic diagram of the ocular surface, and from this, we determined its size (i.e., largest dimension) and distance from the limbus. Cartograms were constructed to illustrate the size and location of the corneal infiltrates according to wearing modality and lens type. Useable data pertaining to 111 patients were analyzed. A significant positive correlation was found between the distance of the infiltrate from the limbus versus clinical severity (p = 0.002), but not between the distance of the infiltrate from the limbus versus infiltrate size (p = 0.97). The cartograms revealed a tendency for infiltrates to occur in the superior cornea of patients wearing extended wear silicone hydrogel lenses (p = 0.0002) in the central cornea of patients wearing daily wear hydrogel daily disposable lenses (p = 0.007) and in the peripheral cornea of patients wearing daily wear hydrogel (excluding daily disposable) lenses (p = 0.0006). These data statistically validate the previously held anecdotal notion that CIEs which occur in the peripheral cornea are less clinically severe than those which occur in the central cornea. Consideration of the distribution of CIEs may facilitate a better understanding of the etiology of these events and can serve to alert practitioners as to their likely clinical presentation.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Arlington thief nabs strange loot\n\nA car prowler in Arlington may have gotten a surprise earlier this month.\n\nArlington police blotters are faxed to The Herald every few weeks. Here’s a strange one from April 8:\n\nArlington: The trunk of a car was broken into and beauty school supplies were stolen. A duffle bag containing 8 mannequin heads was also stolen.\n\nCan you imagine the perp getting home and opening that bag? Worse yet, how much did that stuff cost the rightful owner?\n\nHere are some other interesting blotter items from around the county over the past few months:\n\nArlington: The respondent in an anti-harassment order exposed her buttocks to the protected parties. She was taken to jail.\n\nMukilteo: (Caller) requested to speak with an officer regarding his wife being involved in an extramarital affair.\n\nMukilteo: (Caller) reported that there were several juveniles in the neighbor’s yard acting strange and making “ferret noises” there. The juveniles were GOA(gone on arrival.)\n\nMukilteo: Officer responded to the above area regarding someone locked inside a portable toilet. Officer determined that a subject had locked a friend in the port-a-potty. Both thought nothing of the incident. They agreed to leave.\n\nMukilteo: (Caller) requested an officer to “Scare Straight” an 11-year-old caught stealing for the second time. Officer advised that we do not intimidate children. (Caller) decided that the officer was not needed.\n\nStanwood: Police located a vehicle in a public park that had become stuck in a ditch after the occupants had been driving on the grass. The vehicle was impounded after the car had been left abandoned. A person of interest driver has been identified.\n\nReporter’s note: Some folks have asked why we don’t post all the blotters in the county. The short answer is that there are way too many, and most are pretty boring – or involve too many personal details about victims that we wouldn’t release. Some agencies email or send us their blotters every day or fairly regularly, but some only provide blotters in person at the individual police stations. Everett police and Stanwood police both post blotters pretty regularly to their Facebook pages as well.

Waters; and Thomas Waters & Sons.\n\nDuring the Panic of 1825, the Bank of England suspended cash payments due to frequent provincial bank failures, leading to a general run on British banks in December 1825. In December, 1825 public meetings were held at the Guildhall, Carmarthen and at Llandeilo, where votes of public confidence were passed in Waters, Jones & Co. and David Morris & Sons. Both enterprises survived the 1825 crisis but, on 19 January 1832, Waters, Jones & Co. suspended all payments. The partners in Carmarthen Bank at this time were John Waters, Arthur Jones and David Jones, all of Carmarthen.\n\nAttempts were made to avoid bankruptcy, and on 7 February 1832, an agreement was drawn up which recited that the accounts had been inspected on 21 January 1832, and that assets were sufficient to meet liabilities. Under this agreement, Waters, Jones & Co. would meet all the assets of Carmarthen Bank under the supervision of inspectors, who were to receive the proceeds of realisation of the assets on trust for the bank’s creditors. This agreement contained a proviso that if the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., bankers of Lombard Street, London, and certain other creditors holding nine-tenths of the value of the bank’s debts, did not execute the agreement before 1 May 1832, the agreement would be void and a commission of bankruptcy would be issued against Waters, Jones & Co. Although the partners in the bank, and some of the creditors, signed the agreement, the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., who were owed a large amount, did not. A fiat of bankruptcy was issued, and the notes exhibited at the Ivy Bush Hotel, Carmarthen on 11 September 1832, when a first dividend of 5 shillings in the pound was paid.\n\nAccording to one authority, the liabilities of Waters, Jones & Co. amounted to £300,000, and the failure of the bank was the result of ‘issuing notes to the extent of nearly £100,000 upon unmarketable securities, and making advances in opposition to every principle of common sense and common safety. Money was freely lent, without security, to drovers to enable them to purchase cattle, and the wants of a large agricultural district were soothed in a similarly paternal manner.’ It may be that such harsh criticism was due to the writer being a heavy depositor in the bank.\n\nSuccessor in name\nIt was probably after the failure of Carmarthen Bank that David Morris adopted the name, and changed the name of his bank from David Morris & Sons to Carmarthen Bank. David Morris & Sons had been formed from the amalgamation of Morris & Sons, which he had established in Carmarthen, in 1791, and Carmarthen Furnace Bank, which had been established by John Morgan of Furnace House, Carmarthen.\n\nBank notes\nThe earliest known bank note for this bank is for £2 and is dated 10 October 1825. Existing specimens of bank notes issued by the bank are for £1, £2, £5, £8, and £50. So far as is known, it is the only bank in England and Wales that issued a bank note for £8\n\nOther Carmarthenshire banks\nOther Carmarthenshire banks include: Carmarthen Furnace Bank, Llandovery Bank, Llanelly Bank, and David Morris & Sons.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCarmarthenshire Archives Service, Carmarthen Bank Collection\nCarmarthen Bank Note specimen\nMoney and Coins in Wales\nBizFace News Forum, Banking Crisis: \"Lloyds was a safe bank in 1825\", posted 22 October 2008 at 17:35 by Royston\nGaian Economics site\n\nCategory:Banks of Wales\nCategory:Defunct companies of Wales\nCategory:History of Carmarthenshire\nCategory:19th-century establishments in Wales\nCategory:Companies based in Carmarthenshire", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "BMW managed to negotiate exemptions in a number of countries, though. I suspect that the fact they didn't manage to do so in enough is why they didn't sell many. That and the fact that they looked stupid\n\nWhen I first posted in this thread I was of the opinion that helmets will help to protect your head in an accident. However, for experienced riders in certain riding conditions the very low likelihood of an accident occurring means they are not at all essential.\n\nI have now seen some accident data based research that identifies evidence which suggests that wearing a helmet can actually increase the likelihood of head injury. The statistics relating to the number of head injuries when compulsory helmet laws are introduced are especially intriguing....\n\nThe effect of enforced helmet laws: less cycling and no effect on the proportion of head injuries\"Helmet laws in Australia provided excellent data sets with which to test the effectiveness of cycle helmets because a principal effect of the laws was to increase substantially over a short period of time the proportion of cyclists wearing helmets. This enabled a comparison of a very large number of individuals not wearing and then wearing helmets, eliminating most of the other variables present when comparing different people or dissimilar riding conditions.\"\n\n\"At first, reports suggested that legislation had achieved its aim of reducing head injuries. But the researchers did not take into account the very large decline in cycle use brought about by the laws. Robinson found that although more than 75% of cyclists wore helmets post-law, this was mainly because of the disappearance of formerly bare-headed cyclists rather than because of an increase in the absolute numbers wearing helmets. The main effect of the law was to discourage cycling rather than to encourage cyclists to wear helmets. Although cycle use fell on average by about 30%, head injuries fell by only 13%, so the risk of head injury per cyclist would appear to have increased. Furthermore, the proportional reduction in head injuries for cyclists was very similar to that for unhelmeted pedestrians over the same period.\"\n\n\"In 1999, the Australian Road Accident Prevention Research Unit compared head injury rates of cyclists, pedestrians andother road users. All followed similar declining trends, and the data (see graph above) suggests that there was no enduring benefit at all for cyclists. The report concluded that the law had not been cost-effective.\"\n\n\"New Zealand followed Australia with a mandatory helmet law. This law was also found not to have been cost effective and the head injury rate did not decrease more than for the population at large.\"\n\n\"In Canada, too, in those provinces where helmet laws have been enforced, no benefit is apparent. In British Columbia and Nova Scotia there was no change in the proportion of cyclists suffering head injuries post-law, although cycle use fell markedly. In Alberta, the helmet law reduced cycling by children by around 56% while the absolute number of injuries went up.\"\n\nThis research does not identify the marked reduction in head injury incidence, that you would expect to see when compulsory cycle helmet laws are introduced. Does this mean that helmets are infective in preventing head injuries? Or are their other forces at work?\n\nseems if they are to understand the stats then need a good explanation as to why the steady declines in rates before helmets introduced, and why it stopped? its also very old data so in terms of preventative not sure helmets built using 20 year old technology and materials is comparable. It's such an emotive subject, as indeed it sometimes is for motorcyclists where not mandatory, that an independent definitive view is probably hard to find, what this data does show is that it's grey or foggy. Surprised by reduction in cycling, really people enjoyed cycling before but a need for a helmet stopped them, what else is going on with this ?\n\nexactly, but part of it is understanding what questions asked and how data collected to avoid this, so often these technical bits are conveniently \"overlooked\", such as a cyclist is anyone owning a bike ? even if not used in a year but who thinks will in future who is then not a cyclist as says wont use as don't have a helmet, not saying this is applicable in the above data just thinking of examples. A cynic may suggest that the trick to the right answer is in asking the right question..........\n\nWhy are Dutch cyclists more likely to be injured if they wear helmets?\"Although the Netherlands is probably the safest country in the world for cycling, helmet wearing among Dutch cyclists is rare. It has been estimated that only about 0.5 percent of cyclists in the Netherlands are helmeted.\"\n\n\"However, according to Dutch Government data (Rijkswaterstaat, 2008), 13.3 percent of cyclists admitted to hospital were wearing helmets when they were injured. Why does wearing a helmet appear to increase the risk of being injured so substantially?\"\n\n\"The answer is probably related to another statistic. Of the injured cyclists wearing helmets, 50 percent were riding mountain bikes and 46 percent were riding racing bikes (Rijkswaterstaat, 2008). In other words, most helmeted cyclists in the Netherlands are engaged in a competitive activity, with very few making utility trips on the traditional style of Dutch bicycle.\"\n\n\"Crashing is much more likely when racing than when making ordinary trips about town. Because they are moving at substantially higher speeds almost all the time, racing cyclists are more likely to be in collisions requiring hospital treatment. Similarly, mountain bike riders often undertake tricky manoeuvres on rough ground, and are therefore more prone to falls than is the case for commuters, shoppers and school children riding on ordinary streets.\"\n\n\"Helmet wearers in the Netherlands are doing something different from normal everyday cyclists when they are wearing their helmets, which greatly increases their chances of being hospitalised. Helmet wearing is implicated in behaviour which is far more likely to end up in hospital than the cycling done when not wearing a helmet. However, in a country such as the Netherlands, where cycling is a commonplace everyday way of getting around, it is likely that most of the helmeted leisure time mountain and racing bike riders also ride utility bikes for their everyday journeys and they probably then ride unhelmeted. They choose to wear helmets only when they want to face a higher exposure to risk.\"\n\n\"Although the desire to take heightened risk probably comes before the decision to wear a helmet, it is likely that the act of wearing a helmet reinforces the acceptability of taking risks, leading to the taking of even greater risks. In professional sport, people may use helmets, their skill in bike handling and the protection from immediately available specialist medical care in order to facilitate the highest levels of risk taking.\"\n\n\"Sports cyclists wear helmets in an attempt to limit the consequences of the risks they want to take. However, the much greater representation of these cyclists in the hospital statistics suggests that their attempts to limit risks are inadequate for the risks involved. Indeed, putting their faith in 'technical fixes' such as cycle helmets may encourage many people to take greater risks than they should. In cycle sport internationally, the number of deaths in races has increased markedly since helmet use became mandatory.http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1213.html\n\nYes I am a helmet advocate, but when on pootling about rides it often stays hung on my sac.\n\nDoesn't that make your saddle slightly redundant?\n\n.....and the saddle bag too?\n\nCan't believe I missed another 7 page helmet thread. Recently went out riding with an Australian - neither of us wearing helmets BTW in the country bike lanes and nature reserves. I asked about the compulsory helmet wearing in Australia and he reckoned it was necessary due to \"war on the roads with motorists / general disrespect to cyclists\". Pretty sad that an accomplished experienced cyclist MUST wear a helmet due to others' moronic behavior.\n\n_________________Favorite quote on Retrobike: Not worth the petrol to take it to the tip so it's down to the angle grinder to make it small enough to put in the wheely bin.\n\n... Surprised by reduction in cycling, really people enjoyed cycling before but a need for a helmet stopped them, what else is going on with this ?\n\nOne report I read suggested that compulsory helmet use put off women and young, fashion conscious people especially, because it messes up their hair. Messed up hair might seem trivial to a middle aged man with hair that is rarely much over half an inch long, but I guess if I'd spent £50.00 on a hair-do, or half an hour styling it to look like I'd just got out of bed, then maybe it would be an issue.\n\nHaving to wear a helmet for a 10 minute journey to pop to the shops and then have to carry the thing about is also a nuisance. In addition to giving the impression that cycling is dangerous, the added nuisance of having to wear a helmet is likely to put off casual cyclists that are making short, utility journeys, which can easily be replaced by walking, using public transport or going by car, leaving only the committed bicycle enthusiasts.\n\nI think it's easy to see why compulsory helmet use would reduce the number cyclists quite dramatically, there are plenty of people that use a bike as a cheap, practical way of getting about, so as soon as you make it more expensive, and less practical, they think \"sod it, I won't bother\".\n\nWho is online\n\nUsers browsing this forum: Yahoo [Bot] and 19 guests\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot post attachments in this forum", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Broadly speaking, there are two categories of imaging mass spectrometry for dealing with biological samples and industrial products and the like. The first is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the second is secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These methods are described in the following literature, by way of example:\n“Imaging mass spectrometry: a new tool to investigate the spatial organization of peptides and proteins in mammalian tissue sections”, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2002, 6, 676-681, and “Direct molecular imaging of Lymnaea stagnalis nervous tissue at subcellular spatial resolution by mass spectrometry”, Anal. Chem. 2005, 77, 735-741.\nTo mention one example of a method of sample preparation by MALDI, a biological sample is cooled to −18° C. and a 15-μm section (piece) of the biological sample is produced as by using a stainless steel blade. The section is placed on an electrically conductive film and the sample is then dried. The sample surface is thinly coated with a matrix to thereby obtain a MALDI sample, the sample is inserted into a vacuum chamber and MALDI is carried out. There is also a method (laser capture microdissection) in which a biological sample is placed upon a polyethylene film and the macromolecular film is heated momentarily by irradiating it with a laser beam from the back side of the film, thereby transferring the cells at the contact interface to the film. Primarily, a 337-nm nitrogen laser is used in the desorption ionization of the sample ions.\nIt is difficult to reduce the beam diameter of the laser beam to less than several tens of microns with these methods, and since aberration extends over a wide area, the limit on spatial resolution is 50 μm. Further, by using a matrix, which is the most distinctive feature of MALDI, ion detection sensitivity increases markedly. On the other hand, however, spatial resolution is limited since the crystal size of the matrix applied to the sample exceeds 100 μm.\nWith the SIMS method, a metal ion source (Ga+, Au+, etc.) that approximates a point light source is employed and a spatial resolution of less than a micron is attained. However, the energy of the ions is large (10 to 20 keV), incident ions penetrate into the sample over a depth of several hundred angstroms and the sample sustains damage. Consequently, the yield of ions from a readily decomposed sample such as a biological sample declines rapidly with time. Since the sample desorbed is limited to the molecules in the proximity of the surface, the detection sensitivity of ions with respect to biologically related samples is low.\nCluster SIMS has been developed for the purpose of eliminating this drawback. It has become evident that the desorption efficiency of secondary ions increases sharply if gold cluster ions (Aun+) or C60+ ions, for example, are used as the incident ions.\nHowever, a spatial resolution of less than a micron is difficult to obtain because the current of the primary ion beam is small and the ion beam diameter is greater than several microns. These SIMS methods are all difficult to apply to high-mass molecules such as biological macromolecules.\nImaging techniques using MALDI and SIMS of the kind described above are continuing to come into widespread use in the field of life science. With these methods, however, it is difficult to obtain a resolution of less than a micron owing to the fundamental limitations thereof. Accordingly, no matter what improvements are applied to the conventional MALDI and SIMS methods, it is difficult to realize a resolution of less than a micron so long as these are adopted as the basic techniques.\nOn the other hand, with conventional electrospray or nanolaser spray, a sample liquid forms a conical shape (referred to as a “Taylor cone”) at the tip of a capillary and a minute charged droplet is produced from the conical tip. Owing to the viscosity of the liquid, it is fundamentally impossible to impart this droplet with a size of less than a micrometer or submicrometer. The reason for this is that when the tip of the Taylor cone is torn off by the force of the electric field to produce the droplet, the diameter of the tip of the Taylor cone takes on the submicrometer size automatically owing to the viscosity of the liquid. Thus, droplet size capable of being produced by electrospray is decided in the manner of a natural occurrence and it is difficult to achieve a further reduction in size.\nFurther, with conventional electrospray, achieving the nanometer level (nanoelectrospray) is accompanied by the need to reduce capillary diameter. There are many limitations such as clogging. It is difficult to produce a spray and handling is troublesome. Furthermore, with conventional electrospray, an increase in salt concentration results in spraying difficulty and there is a sudden decline in desorption efficiency of ions into the gaseous phase. Accordingly, conventional electrospray cannot be applied to NaCl aqueous solutions on the order of 150 mM, such as physiological saline solution.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "You might expect me to wax rhapsodic about the array of sheep’s and goat’s milk cheeses, or gush about the intensely flavorful charcuterie, or rave about the freshness of the just-caught fish, but no. I’m here to extol a pastry. (And if you think about it, is that really so surprising after all?)\n\nUpon entering Ajaccio’s Boulangerie Galéani (for no discernible reason the only bakery there mentioned in any of the guide books I read) on the first morning of my weekend there in late May, I was met with the sight of these tempting allumettes aux amandes. Sure, we picked up some of the supposedly great canistrelli (like a smallish scone or thick shortbread cookie, but barely sweet and extremely dry), and some awesome cheese tarts made with the local brocciu (fresh sheep’s cheese, similar in texture to ricotta), but the allumette was the star of the show.\n\nImagine a thick twist of puff pastry, probably made with salted butter, dunked in sweet meringue and sprinkled with salted almonds, then baked until crisp and caramelized. Alternately flaky, tender, crunchy, sweet and salty, it was truly one of the most surprising things I’ve eaten in quite a while. We visited other bakeries during our stay, and sampled many delicious things – mostly on the savory end of the spectrum, now that I think about it: turnovers filled with cheese, onions, and Swiss chard, sausages wrapped in croissant dough – but never saw another allumette aux amandes. So my recommendation, if you’re ever in Ajaccio, is to visit the Boulangerie Galéani, skip the canistrelli (which were pretty unimpressive) and the bread (I didn’t see a single good baguette the whole time I was there), and load up on these sweet-and-salty delights.\n\nOf course, the setting in which we ate this pastry could have something to do with it. After hiking up and around a gorgeous peninsula…\n\n…we sat down to a picnic lunch high on a cliff overlooking the Iles Sanguinaires…\n\n…which probably made everything taste better.\n\nOn this day in 2008: Nick’s Provençal Eggplant – a delicious ragoût, which I’m excited to make once eggplant comes back into season…hopefully only a few more weeks now.\n\nI do believe I promised recipes to accompany my Pastry Crawl so that those of you not in Paris can enjoy along with me. With the exception of Christophe Adam, French bakers in general adhere very strictly to the rules of éclair making: e.g. If it’s a chocolate éclair, it has chocolate filling and chocolate icing. If it’s a coffee éclair, it has coffee filling and light brown, hopefully coffee-flavored icing. Rarely is it anything else. And yet, in the United States, a chocolate eclair is almost always filled with vanilla pudding (yes, pastry cream is hardly more than a fancy name for pudding (in the American sense. Don’t make me open the British pudding can of worms.)) and glazed with chocolate. So I suffer none of these compunctions, instead viewing the éclair as a canvas for whatever flavor combination strikes my fancy. On this particular occasion, inspired in part by a recent post on Not Without Salt extolling the virtues of butterscotch pudding, I chose to make my filling butterscotch.\n\nI am admittedly out of practice piping éclairs, my muscle memory being confused between the lusty behemoths we used to make in the States and the skinnier, more uptight ones I became accustomed to making in Paris. You can see examples of both in the above photo, insert fat American joke here.\n\nLet it be noted that the fatter an éclair is, the greater the cream-to-pastry ratio. Do with that what you will.\n\nAnd with nearly three-quarters of the vote, Paris Pastry Crawl is the undisputed winner! Thank you all for voting, and now, let the gluttony commence. We’re going to start off the series with the éclair, quite possibly the most iconic of all French pastries, and certainly the first I was familiar with, thanks to a francophile mother and the Beaverton Bakery (hey! they’re still around!), where she used to take me and my brother after school for a treat if we’d been good… or maybe if she had a hankering herself. Now, of course, I live in Paris, and finding an éclair doesn’t require a special trip, though sometimes it should.\n\nLa Pâtisserie des Rêves has been around for a few years now, but I admit I didn’t feel all that compelled to go. Something about the bell jars covering the pastries on display just seemed so clinical. Impersonal. Sterile. But just before Christmas, chef Philippe Conticini put out a gorgeous book (with an irresistible puffy cover). Onto my Amazon wishlist it went, and what do you know? Santa Claus deemed that I had been a good girl. Flipping through the pages, I realized that these pastries weren’t sterile at all. The swoop of toasted meringue on the lemon tart, the overgrown rolled brioche, the opulent use of vanilla beans – this is the way I like to bake! Obviously, a visit was now in order.\n\nOkay, it’s probably never been anything as strong as hate. But “Confessions of a Macaron Ambivalent” isn’t as good a title, now is it? My general reaction to the macaron-mania of the last few years has been a combination of eye-rolling and ignoring (not unlike what I went through with cupcakes around 2007, but that irritation has mellowed with time, and now I only roll my eyes at stupid cupcakes, by which I mean ones that are more about looking cute than tasting good, or ones that are clearly made just because they’re trendy – red velvet, I’m talking to you here, if people would just take a second to consider how much dye it takes to color a chocolate cake red they would just order a devil’s food cake with cream cheese icing which is a million times better – but I digress, please pardon the run-on parenthetical but I really do hate red velvet cake which is another post entirely). About the macarons, here’s why. The grand majority of macarons are composed of the same four ingredients: egg whites, sugar, almond meal, and food coloring. You whip the egg whites to a meringue, fold in the other stuff, pipe out a gajillion little circles, let them rest so they develop the proper “feet” and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, I fell asleep there. Frankly, the things bore me silly.\n\nExcept.\n\nI don’t know how it happened. I might have Heather to blame, a known macaron-lover at whose birthday party last year they were unavoidable. Or maybe all those pictures on the internet finally wore me down. Probably not, though. No, I think the answer is simpler. Pierre Hermé. His book on the topic was so pretty I almost wanted to buy it. Seeing them lined up in his shop, all shiny with luster dust (which I should be opposed to, but it’s just so pearly and delightful to look at… when it’s used correctly, that is), I couldn’t help but smile. And then one day, hungry for a little sweet snack, I wandered in for a pastry and thought how gorgeous and interesting all his flavor combinations are and how it was a shame I couldn’t take them all home and it hit me that the macarons offered many of these same flavor combinations in bite-size format – I could try three flavors for the price of one individual cake! So it began. One of the flavors I chose that day was white truffle and hazelnut, and I admit I picked it because I thought it would be disgusting and therefore justify my dislike of the macaron in general. Oh, how wrong I was. The thing is marvelous – you start with a nose full of truffle and you think it’s going to be too turpentiney-strong, but then there’s a crunch of rich, buttery hazelnut and the whole thing is brought into balance.\n\nSo I could no longer justify my annoyance with the macaron based on its taste. (Which is not to say there aren’t hordes of really bad, too-dry or too-sweet or too electric blue examples out there. There are.) However, I learned something a couple of weeks ago that might just blow the top off this whole macaron charade. You see, IT’S ALL A LIE!\n\nAccording to L’Art Culinaire Français, a classic tome of French cookery published in 1950, macarons aren’t macarons at all. While poring over said book with my good friend Jennifer, a fellow Macaron Eye-Roller, we discovered that the traditional macaron is a much more rustic affair – no meringue, so they’re denser, and the almonds less finely ground, so they have some texture. There’s also no filling in this classic recipe. Pictured next to the macaron in the accompanying photo was something called a “patricien” which was identical in looks and method to the little pastry we know as the macaron today. It’s not really all that scandalous, I admit, but when and why did the name change? Was “patricien” too snooty? Did someone misread their pastry history book at some point and the whole misnomer spiraled out of control? At any rate, I have a new reason to scoff at my secretly-not-hated macaron, and will continue to do so, even as I nip into Pierre Hermé for another fix.\n\n* In case you’re wondering about the flavors of the macarons pictured here, they are Quince & Rose (gorgeous), Chocolat Porcelana (yes, Hannah-who-also-buys-foods-she-thinks-she-won’t-like, you read that right, he made a macaron out of the Precious, and it was wonderful, with cocoa nibs pressed into the cream filling), and the afore-lauded White Truffle & Hazelnut.\n\nLike this:\n\nJust a quick update, because this week is pure insanity, but I got to spend Saturday with the lovely Katia and Kyliemac, of K&K Podcast fame. We took a field trip to the pâtisserie where I work, picked up some tasty treats to sample, and went back to the studio to record a couple of shows. The first one, episode 441, is already up, and the second one should be posted midweek. I hope you’ll listen!\n\nIn fact, I think you should be listening to Katia and Kyliemac anyway. I dare you to read one of their show titles and not want to listen. They are a dynamic duo, whether they’re interviewing “interesting people doing interesting things” or just chatting about the expat life or current issues in Paris. It’s easy to spend the whole afternoon listening, and I expect you’ll soon consider them friends, as I do.\n\nUPDATE: Episode 442 is now up, in which we talk about some of the secrets of the pastry shop and the life of a pastry chef!\n\nLike this:\n\nIt’s easy to forget, with all the snow and holiday hoopla, just how much of winter is still yet to come after the new year. The French use Epiphany as an excuse to keep eating sweets throughout the month of January, in the form of the galette des rois. And I think they’re right. Gloomy January days are no time to give up the pleasures of rich, buttery doughs baked to an appealing golden brown or sweet, nutty fillings. Besides, Philly cream cheese has finally arrived in France! I think we should celebrate with some rugelah.\n\nYou might spell it another way (I most often see “rugelach”), but orthography aside, this is really a wonderful little pastry. Crumbly cream cheese dough, sticky fruit and nuts, and ridiculously easy to make. Rugelah come from the Eastern European Jewish baking tradition, and I first learned to bake them in a Jewish-owned, European-style bakery in Dallas, of all places. The ones we made there were filled with walnuts, which I can’t eat, so I had to sate myself with the incredible smell of roasted flour and caramelized jam when I pulled them out of the (enormous) oven every night.\n\nOne Thanksgiving the chef took pity on me and let me use the filling for the pecan rings in the rugelah so I could finally taste them. My nose had not let me down – they were fantastic. Since then, I’ve had to make my own walnut-free version at home from time to time.\n\nLike this:\n\nI know it’s been a while since I’ve posted here. December is brutal on pastry chefs everywhere. I figured out that my workday is a solid three hours longer during the holidays than it is in the summer, and lunch breaks are shorter or nonexistent. Naturally, when I come home at the end of the day I’m exhausted, and it often comes down to a choice between blogging or showering and eating dinner. I don’t think anyone can blame me for choosing the latter. That said, this is going to be a big post, and I hope it will make up for my absence.\n\nI believe I mentioned that Nick and I took a weekend trip to Lisbon a few weeks ago. We had a fantastic time, and it makes me wonder what took me so long to visit Portugal.\n\nI was struck immediately by how colorful the city is. I took tons of pictures of the tile-covered and pastel-painted buildings, and I know Nick got at least twice as many. I’ve put some of my favorites up in a Flickr set, which I invite you to browse. Compared to the gray of Paris in winter, the sunshine and bright colors of Portugal were just what I needed.\n\nWe flew in on a Thursday night, and after grabbing a cheap cab to our hotel, we whipped out our guidebook in search of a nearby restaurant. Cervejaria Ribadouro turned out to be just across the street, and was a good introduction to typical Portuguese restaurants. They had several tanks of live seafood in the front, with market prices by the kilo listed nearby. In addition to the lobsters, crabs, and cod, the menu had a large selection of meats, most of which were pork. Nick made up his mind to order the pork with clams as soon as he saw it, and we later learned that this is a very traditional pairing in Portuguese cuisine. I had the black pork, which was juicy and flavorful. We started with bread and a stuffed crab, and washed it all down with a couple of big, cheap beers.\n\nThe next morning, we began on a quest that would carry us through the weekend: eating as many custard tarts as possible.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Q:\n\nC/C++ bluetooth program to interact with Nrf connect android app\n\nI am writing a C program to interact with the nrf connect android app on my mobile. I installed libbluetooth-dev on my linux machine for development. The requirement is I need to find the bluetooth USB dongle which is on my Linux machine on the nrf connect app. Then I need to connect from the mobile app to the Linux machine and thenexchange data. To achieve this I wrote the program such that, it first creates a RFComm socket, listens to it and accepts connection if anyone wants to connect and then use Read/write calls to exchange data. The problem is I dont know how to make the USB dongle visible so that it is discoverable on the nrf connect app. \nI tried googling around a lot but couldnt find any working suggestions.\n\nA:\n\nBluetooth Low Energy advertisement is different from making device discoverable. Read this link for a high level explanation of it. Bluez is the name of Linux Bluetooth stack and it exposes DBus API's for all Bluetooth operations. If you want your Linux device to start advertising, you need to use Bluez DBus API. Download Bluez source and see doc/advertising-api.txt file to know DBus API for advertisement. For a python example code see test/example-advertisement. \nDefault Linux BLE advertisement interval is 1.2 seconds. So, once you register advertisement with Bluez, using its DBus API, your Linux machine advertises its presence every 1.2 second and nRFConnect Mobile app will find it and shows it in its list.\nBut advertisement only helps to find the device. To read and write data (read and write is BLE terminology) you need to implement GATT services. Read this link to know more, in case you don't know about it. For implementing GATT services in Linux, Bluez has DBus APIs, see doc/gatt-api.txt. For python example of how to use these see test/example-gatt-server in Bluez source directory.\nSo, once your nRFConnect Mobile App finds your advertising Linux machine, it shows a Connect Button, if your Linux machine is doing Connectable advertisement. When you click the Connect button, Mobile App performs GATT discovery and retrieves all the GATT services implemented by your Linux Bluetooth application. It then shows up read and write options, using which you can do data transmission.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

In other words, the compiler thinks it could be a Multimap<Integer, String>, or Multimap<Short, String>, or Multimap<Number, String>, etc.  For this reason you can't call map.get(Number), because as far as the compiler knows, it could be a Multimap<Double, String>.\nThe reason this can't be done is more evident with put.  Should you be able to do put(Number, String) on map?  No, because if it happened to be a Multimap<Integer, String>, you could then add a Double key which will then have violated the integrity of the map.\nWith the normal Map<K, V> interface, this isn't a problem as get is defined as get(Object), not get(K).\nPaul's answer has a great workaround to this situation.  Essentially he is using an intermediate generic method to give the unknown type (in this case represented by capture#5-of ? extends Number) a name (the type parameter T).  This allows you to associate the captures occurring in two different contexts so that you can do something across those contexts.\n\nA:\n\nYou should be able to use a generic method to achieve what you want:\npublic static <T extends Number> void outputNumber(Multimap<T, String> map) {\n    for (T key : map.keySet()) {\n        Collection<String> strings = map.get(key);\n        output(strings);\n    }\n}\n\nThe reason it doesn't work with a wildcard is because ? extends Number means some unknown type that is or extends Number. Meanwhile, Number key could reference some other, incompatible type (for all the compiler knows).\n\nA:\n\npublic static void output(Multimap<? extends Number, String> map) {\n    for (Collection<String> strings : map.asMap().values()) {\n        output(strings);\n    }\n}\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Q:\n\n¿Cuál es el origen de \"meapilas\"?\n\nExiste en España el insulto meapilas para referirse a alguien afectado, frágil, no del todo claro entre lo que dice sobre la moral y lo que acaba haciendo:\n\nJuan es un meapilas: se pasa el día pidiendo a la gente que sea buena pero luego es incapaz de ayudar a una viejecita a cruzar la calle.\n\nEl DLE recoge:\n\nmeapilas\n  De mear y pila2.\n  1. m. santurrón.\n\nQue a su vez nos lleva a mear como sinónimo de orinar (¡o peer!) y:\n\nsanturrón, na\n  Del despect. de santo.\n  1. adj. Exagerado en los actos de devoción. U. t. c. s.\n  2. adj. Gazmoño, hipócrita que aparenta ser devoto. U. t. c. s.\npila2\n  Del lat. pila 'mortero'.\n  1. f. Pieza grande de piedra o de otra materia, cóncava y profunda, donde cae o se echa el agua para varios usos.\n  2. f. Pieza de piedra, cóncava, con su pedestal de la misma materia, y tapa de madera, que hay en las iglesias parroquiales para administrar el sacramento del bautismo.\n  3. f. Parroquia o feligresía.\n\nPero claro, la imagen que nos acaba generando es la de alguien que orina en una pila bautismal, que es algo bastante más hooliganizado que el disloque puramente moral de quien así se define.\nPor todo ello, me pregunto: ¿cuál es el origen de meapilas? ¿Se usa fuera de España? ¿Es correcta la definición que di inicialmente del término?\n\nA:\n\nEncuentro dos casos en el CORDE, pero uno no me deja muy claro el significado de la palabra. El otro creo que sí:\n\n24 diciembre, sábado\n¡Que no, puchas! ¡Que esto no es la Nochebuena! Aunque el torda del tío se emperre que es mejor que aquello. Pero, como yo le digo, de qué, tío, sí no hay cosa con cosa. Que me diga que esto es como la noche San Juan allá, pase, pero de lo otro, ni hablar. Una cerveza aquí, una horchata allá, un trago en el otro sitio, que no son formas, vamos. Luego los belenes, si les pones nieve, mal; si les pones calor, peor. Uno, mal que bien, tiene sus creencias y de esta manera parece como que todo fuese una coña. Y no es que uno sea un meapilas, pero las cosas serias, serias son y no hay por qué menearlas.\nMiguel Delibes, \"Diario de un emigrante\", 1958 (España).\n\nPor el contexto yo diría que meapilas se refiere a un santurrón en el sentido de \"devoto exagerado\". Entiendo que este significado de meapilas pudo originarse por la idea de que alguien pueda pasar tanto tiempo en la iglesia que no tenga más remedio que hacer sus necesidades donde le pille con tal de no abandonarla.\nPor si no queda claro, en el CREA hay casos más recientes que insisten en ese significado:\n\nDice Emilio: -Enfermo me pone esto de Castilla Imperial. Aquí en Taranco, en el valle, es donde por primera vez apareció la palabra Castilla. Fue en el acta fundacional del monasterio. Pues aquí lo vienen a celebrar unos tipos cultos, gente del Opus, los Satunotes les llaman, y hablan de lo castellano y le dan varapalo a la cultura del calimocho. Pero lo cojonudo es que vinieron también los comuneros y, coño, los dos iban por lo castellano, la identidad y estas cosas, pero salieron echando pestes, que ellos eran izquierdistas y los otros, meapilas.\nLa Vanguardia, 16/05/1995.\n\nAhí directamente está llamando meapilas a la gente del Opus, entiendo nuevamente que en su sentido de \"devoto exagerado\". Por lo que creo que tu idea inicial del significado de la palabra puede estar equivocada.\nEn todo caso, el problema veo que está en las dos definiciones de santurrón: yo he estado haciendo alusión a la primera acepción, pero tiene una segunda que sí que describe tu idea inicial. Y dado que la redirección de meapilas a santurrón no especifica a cuál de las dos acepciones de esta se refiere, la gente la puede usar como indicas, en plan despectivo y significando \"hipócrita\".\nVeo en el blog de Ya está el listo que todo lo sabe que hay una entrada sobre esta palabra:\n\nComenzó a utilizarse el término ‘meapilas’ para referirse a aquellos beatos de misa y confesión diaria, ya que se creía que de tanto ir a la iglesia y persignarse con el agua bendita acabarían orinándola.\n\nEsta interpretación desde luego es más respetuosa y menos hereje: no es que mees en las pilas, sino lo que hay en las pilas. Y aclara que, efectivamente, en los últimos años está virando el significado hacia lo que tú comentas:\n\nDesde un tiempo a esta parte se le cambió el sentido original y es frecuente escuchar la expresión ‘ese es un meapilas’ con la intención de señalar la poca importancia del mismo e indicar que está falto de personalidad.\n\nAunque indica que este cambio no se sabe a ciencia cierta cuándo tuvo lugar. Incide también en este origen \"El Gran Libro de los Insultos\", de Pancracio Celdrán (publicado en 2008):\n\nEs voz compuesta en la que el término pila alude a la del agua bendita situada a la entrada del templo y usada para persignarse o santiguarse quien entra en el lugar sagrado. Por otro lado, el verbo mear está empleado en sentido figurado: lo que mea el santurrón es el agua bendita de tanto tomarla.\n\nDefine además este libro la palabra meapilas como:\n\nSanturrón, beato; measalves o persona hipócrita que se da golpes en el pecho y entona el Yo pecador, pero cuya conducta no está a la altura de su pretendida piedad.\n\nLo cual incide también en la variante hipócrita de la palabra.\nEn cuanto al ámbito temporal, el primer caso que encuentro en el CORDE es el mencionado de 1958. No encuentro casos en la hemeroteca de la BNE pero sí en la del periódico ABC, siendo el primero de 1967:\n\nQuienes suelen pensar que los hombres de Acción Católica o de las demás organizaciones apostólicas son -lo que en un lenguaje muy vulgar y con perdón-, suele llamarse meapilas, santurrones preocupados de sus devociones, pero desenganchados de los dolores del mundo, se hubieran llevado un buen chasco asistiendo a esta Asamblea.\n\nCurioso que este texto nos explica que las dos acepciones de santurrón no son tan diferentes: si eres un meapilas eres un devoto tan exagerado que pierdes el vínculo con la realidad y no aplicas tu santidad hacia los demás. Siguiendo con la línea temporal, comentar que el Ngram nos da un caso anterior, de 1949, correspondiente a un ejemplar de la Revista de dialectología y tradiciones populares, haciendo referencia a los apodos que se usan en la provincia de Burgos:\n\nVILLADIEGO - Meapilas. Los de los pueblos inmediatos les cantan la copla siguiente: Cuando sale la luna / sale el lucero / salen los meapilas / de Villadiego.\n\nAntes de esta fecha no encuentro nada por ninguna parte, así que ignoro hacia cuándo pudo ser el origen de la expresión en su forma oral.\nPara concluir, comentar que todos los casos encontrados tanto en el CORDE (2) como en el CREA (29) como en el CORPES (40) son todos de España, por lo que parece poco probable que la expresión haya pasado a América.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "Dark clouds are once again hovering over the planned construction of the Hinkley Point C (HPC) nuclear power station in Britain, which has attracted much attention as the most ambitious nuclear power project in Europe. Despite the extraordinary high estimated costs of building the plant and generating power there, the project has managed to survive so far with the support of the successive governments.\n\nFrom last year to this year, doubts about the costs and related technological problems have surfaced again, creating fear that the government may carry out a “reexamination” of the project anytime soon. Such concerns present a serious threat to Hitachi Ltd. and other Japanese firms that are betting their futures on nuclear power plant construction in Britain.\n\nThe root cause of the uncertainty surrounding the HPC project lies in Electricite de France (EdF), France’s government-owned, largest power utility, which is building the plant. When British Prime Minister Theresa May gave a go-ahead to the project in September 2016, various tricks were used to impress the public with low construction costs, which were initially set at £18 billion (¥2.7 trillion), with some investment from China General Nuclear Power Group thrown in.\n\nWithin less than a year after the plan was announced, EdF started revising cost estimates and other details, which are nothing surprising given the French utility’s past behavior. In July last year, for example, EdF said the construction costs will increase by about £1.5 billion. Furthermore, the utility said that the foundation work for the site of the plant would have to done over again and that the completion of the first reactor and generator would be delayed by 15 months.\n\nThe latest plan envisages completion of the power station in 2025 at the total cost of £20 billion. A reporter of a British business newspaper says, however, that nobody will believe any of these figures.\n\nThe HPC nuclear power station will comprise two third-generation European Pressurized Reactors. The trouble is that this type of plant is not yet in operation anywhere in the world. EPRs are currently under construction at the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant in Finland, the Flamanville nuclear power plant in France and the Taishan nuclear power plant in Guangdong province, China. But the startup dates for all three have been postponed from the original targets.\n\nThe date for a trial-run of the Olkiluoto plant was originally set for 2009 but after a series of delays, the target date now is May 2019 — already a delay of 10 years. The construction costs, originally estimated at €3 billion, has nearly tripled to €8.5 billion (about ¥1.15 trillion).\n\nFor the Flamanville plant, the trial-run date has been pushed back by at least six year while the costs have also more than tripled to €10.5 billion. The construction schedule has also been revised for the Taishan plant in China, which was supposed to become the world’s first operating EPR facility in 2016. Late last year, moreover, a defect was discovered in the deaeration equipment of a reactor, casting doubt about the current target of starting operation by the end of 2018. All these incidents point to chronic cost increases and schedule delays associated with EPRs.\n\nConcerns about the costs related to the HPC station are smoldering within the British political circles. The contract between the May administration and EdF includes a “contract for difference” provision, which calls on the British government to purchase electricity from EdF at a rate higher than the market price, with the aim to make the ostensible costs look lower. Under that provision, EdF will receive £92.5 per 1 megawatt-hour of electricity — twice the market price. Moreover, the contract for difference clause is to remain valid for 35 years.\n\nIn the British House of Commons, both ruling and opposition members resent the contract, which they said will only bring exorbitant profits to the French firm. In November, a special audit committee of the House demanded that the government rewrite the contract, claiming that the British taxpayers will have to pay as much as £30 billion to EdF — about ¥4.5 trillion.\n\nIn this situation, the renewable energy industry has launched an attack against the proponents of nuclear power by offering low prices. An offshore wind power generation company recently contracted with the British government to supply electricity at £57.5 per megawatt-hour for 15 years. Its claim for contributing to prevention of global warming, coupled with supplying electricity at a lower price and in a safer way, has helped those calling for a review of the HPC project gather strength.\n\nThe aforementioned British journalist points out that much has changed since the original first of the Hinkley Point reactors started operating in the 1960s. Nobody could imagine the shale oil revolution and the sharp declines in the costs of renewable energy sources, and these drastic changes have made nuclear power generation obsolete, the journalist says. While Germany and France are shifting away from nuclear power, Britain pushes nuclear power generation. It has adopted the policy citing the need to achieve the goal of both ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to the Hinkley Point C project, plans are being floated to construct the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station on Anglesey Island in northern Wales and the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, England — quite a rare expansion of nuclear power in an advanced industrial country.\n\nUndertaking the construction of Wylfa Newydd is Horizon Nuclear Power, a British energy company wholly owned by Hitachi Ltd. of Japan. The British government is now faced with an unexpected rise in the construction costs, due to additional safety measures necessitated by the nuclear disaster at Tokyo Electric Power’s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in March 2011, such as the hardening of the plant site with concrete. This has proved once again that nuclear energy is no longer an inexpensive means of generating electricity in comparison not only with fossil fuels but also with renewable energy sources.\n\nMay decided on the HPC project shortly after taking office when her approval rating was high. Now, however, the future of her government is not certain and the situation is getting worse with Britain’s coming exit from the European Union crushingly weighing on it. But she has kept silent on a series of demands for a reexamination of the project.\n\nIn France, meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron picked Nicolas Hulot, an ardent environmentalist, for the post of minister of ecological and solidary transition. Hulot’s current interest is pushing for an expanded use of electric vehicles. But his stance of calling for phasing out nuclear power generation has not changed.\n\nThe uncertainty of the future of the HPC project demonstrates that there are too many uncertain factors for Hitachi to think of what next step to take. There are a mountain of things on which the company must carry out in-depth studies before betting its future on present British politicians.\n\nThis is an abridged translation of an article from the March issue of Sentaku, a monthly magazine covering political, social and economic scenes.

{"text": "Organ growth functions in maturing male Sprague-Dawley rats based on a collective database.\nTen different organ weights (liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, adrenals, testes, epididymes, and seminal vesicles) of male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats of different ages (1-280 d) were extracted based on a thorough literature survey database. A generalized Michaelis-Menten (GMM) model, used to fit organ weights versus age in a previous study (Schoeffner et al., 1999) based on a limited data, was used to find the best fit model for the present expanded data compilation. The GMM model has the functional form: Wt = (Wt(o).K(gamma) + Wt(max).Age(gamma))/(K(gamma) + Age(gamma)) where Wt is organ/tissue weight at a specified age, Wt(o) and Wt(max) are weight at birth and maximal growth, respectively, and K and gamma are constants. Organ weights were significantly correlated with their respective ages for all organs and tissues. GMM-derived organ growth and percent body weight (%BW) fractions of different tissues were plotted against animal age and compared with experimental values as well as previously published models. The GMM-based organ growth and %BW fraction profiles were in general agreement with our empirical data as well as with previous studies. The present model was compared with the GMM model developed previously for six organs--liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain--based on a limited data, and no significant difference was noticed between the two sets of predictions. It was concluded that the GMM models presented herein for different male S-D rats organs (liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, adrenals, testes, epididymes, and seminal vesicles) are capable of predicting organ weights and %BW ratios accurately at different ages.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Facts\n\n       In August 2003, Applicant, Orian Lee Scott, moved to Maxey, outside of Paris,\n\nTexas, and he started asking around town for a few boys to help him move and unpack\n\nboxes. A mother of twin teenage boys heard about Scott’s inquiries and got in touch with\n\nhim.2 He told her that he was looking to hire some teenage kids to help out around his\n\nhouse. He also told her that he would pay her boys ten dollars an hour each. The mother\n\nthought that was an exceptionally high wage, and she agreed to let her kids work for Scott\n\nthe rest of the summer.3 The boys worked Monday through Friday. Once school began,\n\nhowever, the job was supposed to end, but Scott said that he still needed help around the\n\nhouse maintaining his yard, painting his barn, and bathing his dogs. The boys’ mother\n\nagreed to let her kids work on Saturdays during the school year. They worked about six\n\nhours each Saturday. Around Thanksgiving, Scott asked them whether they had a friend\n\nthat could also help around the house. They said that they did, and their friend started\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The mother learned about Scott’s offer through her husband. Although the family lived\nin Fort Towson, Oklahoma, her husband worked in Paris for about 9 years.\n       3\n         One of the victims testified that, after he worked for Scott, he worked at Sonic and got\npaid the minimum wage of about five dollars per hour, and that he has never again been paid ten\ndollars per hour to work since then. Another boy testified that the work was not worth what they\nwere getting paid and that there was not enough work to justify hiring three boys. The record also\nshows that the boys were “on the clock” even when they were not working, such as when they\nwere sitting around playing on Scott’s computer or showering.\n\f                                                                                          Scott–3\n\nworking for Scott too.\n\n       When the kids first started bathing Scott’s dogs in the summer, they would do it\n\noutside and usually did not wear shirts. On one occasion, Scott videotaped them washing\n\nhis dogs, allegedly because he needed to “test” an old camera. As the days got colder,\n\nhowever, Scott told the boys to bathe the dogs in his guest bathroom. He even suggested\n\nto one of them that the dogs would not mind if the kids bathed them in the nude. The boy\n\nrefused. Later, Scott provided each of them with swim trunks to use so that their clothes\n\nwould not get dirty when they washed the dogs.4\n\n       After awhile, Scott encouraged the kids to take a shower after bathing the dogs and\n\ndoing yard work. The shower in Scott’s guest bathroom had no curtain, and Scott never\n\ninstalled one, even though the boys took showers there almost every week for over six\n\nmonths.5 Scott told them that, if they cleaned up (i.e., showered at his house), he would\n\ntreat them to dinner and a movie.6 One of the twins testified that he and his brother\n\nthought that the bathroom was a little creepy and that they even looked for a camera at\n\none point but never found one. Unfortunately, there was a camera. The clock radio in the\n\n\n\n       4\n        There was testimony that this was unnecessary because the boys could bathe the dogs\nwithout getting their clothes dirty. There was also testimony questioning why Scott had four pairs\nof swim trunks that fit the kids he hired.\n       5\n         One boy testified that when he asked Scott why he did not have a shower curtain, Scott\nreplied that he did not need one. Another boy testified that Scott evaded the question when asked.\n       6\n        Scott took the boys to a movie and dinner almost every weekend that they worked for\nhim after school started, and he paid for everyone’s dinner and movie tickets even though the\nboys earned about $60 per day working for Scott.\n\f                                                                                     Scott–4\n\nbathroom had a hidden camera in it, which was pointed directly at the bathtub. It was later\n\ndiscovered that the hidden camera was hooked up to a VCR system and that Scott had\n\nfilmed almost every shower the boys had taken. The videos that Scott recorded showed\n\nthat the boys would often masturbate while they showered. They also showed that Scott\n\nadjusted the hidden camera numerous times to get a better angle, and one of the videos\n\neven showed Scott in the bathroom simulating masturbation to check the angle of the\n\ncamera. Scott also installed a light in the bathroom that was above the shower so that he\n\ncould see better. After he was arrested, police discovered a newly drilled hole in the\n\nbathroom opposite the hidden camera that would have given a camera operator a full-\n\nfrontal view of the children while showering and masturbating.\n\n         Scott would occasionally allow the boys to use his computer to play games, and\n\none day while on the computer, the twins found pornographic images of young boys.\n\nThey told their mother, who later called the police. The police searched Scott’s home and\n\nseized recordings of the kids masturbating in the shower, thousands of digital images of\n\nchild pornography on Scott’s computer, thousands of images of child pornography Scott\n\nkept on physical media at his house (e.g., DVDs, CDs, over 400 floppy disks, etc.), and\n\nphotographs in a shoe box of underage teenage boys in swimsuits at what appeared to be\n\na pool party. It looked like the photographs were taken through a window or sliding glass\n\ndoor. Police also noticed that Scott was almost finished building a swimming pool at his\n\nhouse.\n\f                                                                                         Scott–5\n\n                                  B. Procedural Posture\n\n       In three separate indictments, Scott was charged with three counts of inducing a\n\nsexual performance by a child, three counts of producing or promoting a sexual\n\nperformance by a child, and three counts of possession of child pornography. Each\n\nindictment referred to a different victim. Scott pled guilty to the child-pornography\n\ncharges but went to trial on the other counts. The jury found him guilty of all six of the\n\nremaining charges. For each of the inducing-a-sexual-performance convictions, the jury\n\nsentenced Scott to twenty years’ confinement (for a total of sixty years); for each of the\n\nproducing-or-promoting convictions, the jury sentenced Scott to ten years’ imprisonment\n\n(for a total of thirty years); and for each of the possession-of-child-pornography\n\nconvictions, the jury sentenced Scott to ten years’ confinement (for a total of thirty years).\n\nThe trial judge ordered the inducing-a-sexual-performance convictions and the\n\nproducing-or-promoting convictions to run consecutively and for Scott’s child-\n\npornography convictions to run concurrent to his stacked sentences. In all, Scott was\n\nsentenced to 100 years’ confinement.\n\n       On appeal, Scott raised various arguments, including that the evidence was legally\n\ninsufficient to support his convictions for inducing a sexual performance by a child. Scott\n\nv. State, 173 S.W.3d 856, 869 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005). The court of appeals\n\nagreed, and it rendered acquittals on those counts. Id. On discretionary review, this Court\n\nleft in place the court of appeals’ judgments entering acquittals. Scott v. State, 235\n\f                                                                                      Scott–6\n\nS.W.3d 255, 261 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Scott later filed a post-conviction writ\n\napplication alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. We remanded the application to the\n\nhabeas court because the record was insufficiently developed. In particular, we instructed\n\nthe habeas judge to respond to Scott’s ineffective-assistance claim and to determine if any\n\nof his sentences had been discharged. Ex parte Scott, Nos. WR-83,185-07, -08, -09, -10, -\n\n11, & -12, 2015 WL 4594085 (Tex. Crim. App. July 29, 2015) (not designated for\n\npublication) (per curiam order). Although the judge noted which sentences Scott had\n\ndischarged, he did not make a recommendation regarding whether Scott should get relief\n\non the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel at the punishment phase. Ex parte Scott,\n\nNos. WR-83,185-07, -08, -09, -10, -11, & -12, 2015 WL 8954906 (Tex. Crim. App. Dec.\n\n16, 2015) (not designated for publication) (per curiam order). We remanded the\n\napplication again, and the habeas court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nrecommending that we deny relief on the ineffective-assistance issue. We filed and set\n\nScott’s application to determine whether his counsel was ineffective at the punishment\n\nphase. Id.\n\n                                 II. HABEAS CORPUS\n\n                                        A. Claims\n\n       Scott argues that his counsel performed deficiently in a number of respects:\n\n       •      by failing to produce any mitigating evidence at the punishment stage to\n              support a lesser sentence, namely eliciting good character evidence from\n              family members and calling Dr. JoAnn Ondrovick to testify that Scott\n              would be a good candidate for her rehabilitation program;\n\f                                                                                        Scott–7\n\n\n       •      by failing to object to Scott being sentenced to 100 years in prison as a\n              violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual\n              punishment;\n\n       •      by failing to object to the stacking of Scott’s sentences;\n\n       •      by making a deficient argument during closing;\n\n       •      by not objecting to various instances of improper argument by the State\n              during its closing; and\n\n       •      by not objecting to a comment on the weight of the evidence made by the\n              trial judge.\n\n                              B. Findings and Conclusions\n\n       The habeas court did not hold a hearing, but numerous affidavits were submitted,\n\nincluding two from Quannah Dixon (Scott’s sister), two from Michael Scott (one of\n\nScott’s brothers), two from Orian Scott (Applicant), and two from trial counsel. The\n\nhabeas court found trial counsel’s affidavits credible, but not those of Dixon, Michael, or\n\nApplicant, and it entered a number of relevant findings and conclusions:\n\n       •      [Defense counsel]’s failure to call witnesses to testify on behalf of\n              [Scott] . . . was reasonable in that family witnesses refused to attend\n              trial and the expert witness [Ondrovick] consulted by [defense\n              counsel] was hostile to [Scott] and her testimony would have been\n              harmful to [Scott].\n\n       •      [Scott] was not prejudiced[.] [T]he very type of evidence [Scott]\n              would solicit from [his brother and sister] -- that [he] was a\n              successful, career educator, had serious medical problems and a\n              family that loved him -- was presented to the jury by [defense\n              counsel] during his closing argument without objection from the\n              prosecutor.\n\f                                                                                 Scott–8\n\n•   [Defense counsel]’s decision not to call Ondrovick was reasonable\n    and appropriate in that she would have testified that [Scott] was not a\n    suitable candidate for her treatment program and that she was angry\n    about having to come to court during the holiday season.\n\n•   [Scott]’s sentence was not violative of the 8th Amendment\n    prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in that each\n    sentence was within the statutory range of punishment for the\n    offenses of conviction as provided by the Texas Penal Code.\n\n•   [Defense counsel]’s failure to object to the trial court’s sua sponte\n    stacking of sentences would have been futile because the stacking of\n    sentences was either mandatory or within the sole discretion of the\n    trial judge.\n\n•   [Defense counsel]’s failure to object to certain portions of the\n    prosecution’s closing argument regarding character and other\n    potential victims in other states . . . was a reasonable trial strategy in\n    that the objections might have drawn the jury’s particular attention to\n    that argument.\n\n•   [Scott] was not prejudiced because of the prosecutor[’]s argument\n    and failure of [defense counsel] to object due to the overwhelming\n    evidence of [Scott]’s guilt and the quantity and nature of the\n    evidence presented by the prosecution at the sentencing hearing.\n    [Scott] pled “Guilty” to possessing child pornography. He\n    maintained a large quantity of pornographic images and disturbing\n    photographs depicting teenage boys and young men all of which was\n    appropriately before the jury at punishment. [Scott] demonstrated a\n    sophisticated and premeditated pattern of luring and recording\n    teenage boys in the shower on multiple occasions. These recordings\n    were kept as part of a larger collection of homoerotic pornography.\n    Furthermore, the very type of character evidence [Scott] would\n    solicit from [his sister and brother] -- that [he] was a successful,\n    career educator, had serious medical problems and a family that\n    loved him -- was presented to the jury by [defense counsel] during\n    his closing argument without objection. Finally, it was\n    uncontroverted that [Scott] had no criminal history and all trial\n    counsel argued accordingly.\n\f                                                                                        Scott–9\n\n      •      [Defense counsel]’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s\n             characterization of [Scott] as a “pedophile” . . . was reasonable in\n             that the [Scott] had pled “Guilty” to multiple counts of Possession of\n             Child Pornography and the jury had found [Scott] “Guilty” of\n             multiple counts of Inducing a Sexual Performance by a Child and\n             Producing or Promoting a Sexual Performance by a Child.\n\n      •      [Scott] was not prejudiced because the evidence showed -- and the\n             jury found beyond a reasonable doubt -- that [Scott] was guilty of\n             offenses involving children and [Scott] had expended considerable\n             effort and planning to procure, produce and collect these\n             pornographic images.\n\n      •      The defense strategy was reasonable not to object to the trial judge’s\n             comment that it was “a fair assumption based upon the\n             record” . . . because it might have drawn the jury’s attention to that\n             evidence.\n\n      •      [Scott] was not prejudiced by the trial judge’s single comment and\n             [defense counsel]’s failure to object to it due to the overwhelming\n             evidence of . . . [Scott]’s guilt, [and] the quantity and quality of the\n             evidence presented by the prosecution at the sentencing hearing.\n             [Scott] pled “Guilty” to possessing child pornography. He\n             maintained a large quantity of pornographic images and disturbing\n             photographs depicting teenage boys and young men all of which was\n             appropriately before the jury at punishment. [Scott] demonstrated a\n             sophisticated and premeditated pattern of luring and recording\n             teenage boys in the shower on multiple occasions. These recordings\n             were kept as part of a larger collection of homoerotic pornography.\n             [defense counsel] also argued without objection that [Scott]’s family\n             members would testify that Scott was a successful, career educator,\n             had serious medical problems and a family that loved him (although\n             they declined to appear at trial).\n\nThe habeas court recommends that we deny relief.\n\n                 III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n                                       A. The Law\n\f                                                                                      Scott–10\n\n       The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Cooks v. State, 240 S.W.3d 906, 911 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); see U.S. C ONST.\n\namend. VI. To prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, an applicant must\n\nprove that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the\n\ndeficiency. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Ex parte Martinez, 330\n\nS.W.3d 891, 900 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n       Under the first prong of Strickland, an applicant must prove deficient performance\n\nby showing that his counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688–89. An objective standard of reasonableness\n\nis defined by prevailing professional norms at the time of trial, and there is a presumption\n\nthat counsel’s performance conformed to those norms. Id. To overcome the presumption,\n\nan applicant must rely on evidence firmly rooted in the record,7 unless no reasonable trial\n\nstrategy could justify counsel’s conduct. Andrews v. State, 159 S.W.3d 98, 102–03 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2005). When no reasonable trial strategy could justify counsel’s conduct, his\n\nconduct is deficient as a matter of law, regardless of whether the record adequately\n\nreflects counsel’s motivations for employing that strategy. Id. We review the performance\n\nof counsel by considering the totality of the circumstances as they existed at the time of\n\ntrial, without the benefit of hindsight or by relying on only isolated circumstances at trial.\n\nSee Ex parte Flores, 387 S.W.3d 626, 633–34 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\n       7\n       Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688–89; Lopez v. State, 343 S.W.3d 137, 142–43 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2011).\n\f                                                                                          Scott–11\n\n       To prove prejudice in this context, an applicant must prove that a reasonable\n\nprobability exists that, but for counsel’s deficient conduct, the punishment jury would\n\nhave returned a more favorable verdict (i.e., a lesser punishment). Ex parte Rogers, 369\n\nS.W.3d 858, 863 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). A reasonable probability is one that is\n\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. Id. at 862–63.\n\n                                     B. Defense’s Strategy\n\n       Because Scott’s ineffective-assistance claims turn on the defense’s strategy, we\n\nreview that strategy now. By the time of trial, Scott was about 70 years old, and because\n\nhe had no criminal history, he was probation eligible on the child-pornography and the\n\npossession-or-promotion charges.8 T EX. C ODE C RIM. P ROC. art. 42.12, § 4(d)(7). Trial\n\ncounsel did not believe that the State could prove the inducing-a-sexual-performance-by-\n\na-minor charges because Scott did not induce the children to masturbate in the shower,\n\nand because Scott was probation eligible on the other charges, the strategy was to fight\n\nthe inducing charges but to ask the jury for mercy and to recommend probation for the\n\nother charges. To support his probation argument, counsel cited Scott’s advanced age and\n\ndeteriorating health,9 claiming that any sentence of confinement was tantamount to a\n\n\n       8\n        Although Scott argued for probation on the child-pornography charges and possession-\nor-promotion charges, he was not eligible for probation on the inducing-a-sexual-performance-\nby-a-child charges because no defendant can be placed on jury recommended probation if they\nare convicted of that crime. TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. art. 42.12, § 4(d)(7).\n       9\n        For example, the evidence showed that he has lymphoma (although it is currently in\nremission), neurosyphilis, gastrointestinal problems, and that he had a stroke while incarcerated\npending trial.\n\f                                                                                           Scott–12\n\ndeath sentence, and that even though Scott admittedly was addicted to pornography and\n\ntechnology, his addictions could be controlled by “close supervision.” Despite this, the\n\ndefense acknowledged during its closing that, based on the facts of the case alone, the\n\njury might “max out” Scott and the judge might stack some of his sentences, but counsel\n\nimplored them not to do that.\n\n       The jury convicted Scott of all nine counts and sentenced him to the maximum\n\nterm of confinement on each count, and the judge stacked Scott’s sentences for inducing\n\nand possession-or-promotion.10 However, on appeal, the defense’s argument regarding the\n\ninducement charges bore fruit. The court of appeals reversed those convictions and\n\nentered acquittals based on insufficient evidence because the State did not prove that\n\nScott induced the children to masturbate. Scott, 173 S.W.3d at 864. On discretionary\n\nreview, this Court let the acquittals stand. Scott, 235 S.W.3d at 257.\n\n                                      C. Mitigating Evidence\n\n       The first issues we address are Scott’s claims that his attorney was ineffective\n\nbecause he did not develop available mitigating evidence. According to Scott, trial\n\ncounsel should have called psychologist Dr. JoAnn Ondrovik; Scott’s sister, Quannah\n\nDixon; and one of Scott’s brothers, Michael Scott, to testify. He also asserts that, had he\n\nbeen given the opportunity, he would have testified on his own behalf about his\n\nmitigating circumstances.\n\n\n\n       10\n            The judge did not have the authority to stack the child-pornography convictions.\n\f                                                                                      Scott–13\n\n                                   1. Dr. JoAnn Ondrovik\n\n       Scott contends that his counsel should have called Dr. JoAnn Ondrovik to testify\n\nbecause she would have stated that Scott was remorseful for his actions. According to\n\ntrial counsel, however, he chose not to call Ondrovik to testify for two reasons. First, it\n\nwas her opinion that, even though Scott was remorseful, she did not think that he could be\n\nsuccessful in her program. Second, Ondrovik was hostile once she arrived at the\n\ncourthouse under order because she was exchanging Christmas presents with her family\n\nwhen she was summoned.\n\n       While it is true that she would have testified that Scott was remorseful for his\n\nactions, her testimony would have also severely undercut the defensive strategy that Scott\n\ncould be rehabilitated if he were placed on probation. Based on this, we cannot say that\n\ntrial counsel employed an unreasonable strategy and was ineffective for not calling\n\nOndrovick to testify. Because the habeas court’s conclusion is supported by the record,\n\nwe adopt its conclusion.\n\n                                      2. Scott’s Siblings\n\n       Dixon and Michael stated in their affidavits that they would have testified about\n\nScott’s generous and giving nature,11 his troubled childhood, his longstanding health\n\nissues, and his unblemished record as an educator for 40 years. They also said that they\n\n\n       11\n         Dixon stated that Scott sold her and her husband a house he owned for $1.00 and helped\npay for two of Dixon’s granddaughters to go to college. He also helped Dixon pay off the\nmortgage on her second home and wrote to her from prison urging her to buy herself a new car\nand television with money from his bank account.\n\f                                                                                             Scott–14\n\nasked trial counsel whether they should testify at the punishment phase and that counsel\n\ntold them that they would not be needed. Trial counsel disagrees, however, and says that\n\nhe spoke to Dixon and Michael on multiple occasions and that he did ask them to testify,\n\nbut both refused to attend the trial.12\n\n       The habeas judge found trial counsel’s affidavits credible, and because that finding\n\nis supported by the record, we adopt it. Ex parte Harleston, 431 S.W.3d 67, 70–71 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2014). Counsel cannot be faulted for failing to call family members to testify\n\nabout Scott’s good character when they refused to appear.\n\n                                 3. Scott’s Proposed Testimony\n\n       Finally, Scott said that he would have testified about his longstanding health\n\nissues, including his depression and suicide attempts, and that he was remorseful for what\n\nhe did to the kids. According to trial counsel, it was a strategic decision not to call Scott\n\nto testify about his health issues. At least one jailer told counsel that Scott acted different\n\nin jail than he did when he was in the courtroom, which corroborated the State’s argument\n\nthat Scott was malingering. The habeas court’s finding that trial counsel’s affidavits were\n\ncredible is supported by the record, and we adopt the court’s conclusion that defense\n\ncounsel was not deficient for failing to call Scott to testify.\n\n\n       12\n          Scott’s brother and sister claim that, but for defense counsel telling them that they did\nnot need to testify, they would have appeared in court and testified as character witnesses.\nHowever, if Scott’s siblings would have attended the trial to testify on his behalf, it is not clear\nwhy they did not at least attend the trial to support him as observers. We do note, however, that\ntrial counsel argued in closing that Scott had a good family that cared for him even though they\ncould not be at trial.\n\f                                                                                    Scott–15\n\n       Trial counsel did not, however, address Scott’s claim that he would have testified\n\nthat he was remorseful. We address it now. On the one hand, Scott’s testimony would\n\nhave provided the only evidence of remorse (given that his siblings refused to testify), and\n\nhad the jury heard that evidence, it could have returned a lesser sentence. On the other\n\nhand, the jury may have found Scott’s testimony utterly incredible given that he pled\n\nguilty to possession of child pornography but pled not guilty to the inducing and the\n\npossession-or-promotion charges. It might also have believed such testimony was\n\ndisingenuous based on Scott’s pattern of behavior and how long it went on. Scott sought\n\nout teenage boys as soon as he moved to Paris, and once he found a few, he immediately\n\nbegan grooming them. Eventually he manipulated them into showering at his house so\n\nthat he could surreptitiously record them. It was later discovered that Scott had recorded\n\nalmost every shower the children took over a six-month period, adjusting the camera and\n\ninstalling lights so that he could see the naked boys better.\n\n       When trial counsel fails to provide his reasoning for taking or not taking action, we\n\nwill find counsel’s performance deficient only if the conduct was so outrageous that no\n\ncompetent attorney would have engaged in it. Andrews, 159 S.W.3d at 101. It is the\n\napplicant’s responsibility to overcome the strong presumption that counsel made a\n\nreasonable strategic decision. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689; Andrews, 159 S.W.3d at 101.\n\nHere, Scott has failed to rebut the presumption that his attorney employed a reasonable\n\ntrial strategy because the impact of Scott’s testimony would have been difficult to gauge.\n\f                                                                                               Scott–16\n\nWe cannot say that any competent attorney would have called Scott to testify under these\n\ncircumstances.13\n\n                       B. Failure to Object to Stacking of Sentences 14\n\n        Next, Scott alleges that his counsel was deficient because he did not object to the\n\n\n\n        13\n           Although not identified as a claim for relief in his writ application or memorandum of\nlaw in support of his writ application, Scott mentions in his affidavits, albeit in passing, that he\nwould have testified at the punishment phase if he had known that he had the right to do so.\n         In the interest of justice we will address the issue. The United States Supreme Court has\nheld that an accused has the federal constitutional right to testify, Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44,\n49 (1987) (constitutional right to testify derives from the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth\namendments of the United States Constitution), and the Texas Constitution provides that the\naccused “shall have the right of being heard by himself or counsel, or both . . . .” TEX . CONST .\nart. I § 10. This Court reviews such claims under the ordinary Strickland standard. Johnson v.\nState, 169 S.W.3d 223, 239 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (federal constitutional right to remain\nsilent); Hernandez v. State, 726 S.W.2d 53, 56–57 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (state constitutional\nright to remain silent). That is, the applicant must show that, but for his attorney’s deficient\nadvice, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. A reasonable probability is one that is sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. Rogers, 369 S.W.3d at 862–63.\n         Here, Scott has not shown that his counsel was deficient. The habeas court believed trial\ncounsel’s affidavit but not those of Scott or his siblings. Trial counsel asserted that, “[w]ithout\n[Scott’s] assistance in showing his human side, I was rather hamstrung on presenting anything\nother than what the evidence showed.” The habeas court was free to believe counsel’s affidavit\nthat Scott would not help to show the jury his human side, and it was free to disbelieve Scott’s\naffidavits that he did not know that he had the right to testify. Furthermore, we have found no\nevidence in the record (other than Scott’s affidavits) that he did not know that he could testify or\nthat he wanted to and was prevented from doing so. It does, however, contain some evidence to\nthe contrary. During voir dire, defense counsel told the jury that Scott would be exercising his\nright to remain silent (i.e., he would not testify). It follows that Scott could have testified if he did\nnot exercise his right to remain silent. Although this is not conclusive, it is some evidence that\nScott did know that he could testify.\n        14\n          Scott also appears to directly challenge his sentences as violative of the Eighth\nAmendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. To the extent that he directly attacks\nhis convictions, his claim is not cognizable in post-conviction writ proceedings. Curry v. State,\n910 S.W.2d 490, 497 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (failure to preserve Eight Amendment claim at trial\nforfeits the claim for appellate review).\n\f                                                                                         Scott–17\n\nstacking of his sentences, which forfeited any claim on appeal that his sentences were\n\nimpermissibly stacked.\n\n        After reviewing the record and the habeas court’s findings of fact and conclusions\n\nof law, we adopt its findings and conclusions that trial counsel was not deficient for\n\nfailing to object to the stacking of Scott’s sentences because such an objection was\n\nfutile.15 To prevail on an improper-stacking claim, Scott would have to show that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion, but he cannot do so on this record because the judge’s ruling\n\nwas authorized by law.16 T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 3.03(b)(2)(A); Bonilla v. State, 452 S.W.3d\n\n811, 815 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\n                                    C. Final Argument Issues\n\n                                  1. Defense’s Closing Argument\n\n        Next, Scott maintains that his trial counsel was deficient when he stated during\n\nclosing that,\n\n        I have developed a relationship with Mr. Scott, and I have developed a\n        relationship with his family, and I do feel sorry for him. You can call me a\n\n        15\n             Ex parte Chandler, 182 S.W.3d 350, 356 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n        16\n        Hammond v. State, 465 S.W.2d 748, 752 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971). In Beedy v. State, 194\nS.W.3d 595, 597 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006), the court of appeals explained that,\n\n        An abuse of discretion generally will be found only if (1) the trial court imposes\n        consecutive sentences when the law requires concurrent sentences, (2) the trial\n        court imposes concurrent sentences when the law requires consecutive ones, or (3)\n        the trial court otherwise fails to observe the statutory requirements pertaining to\n        sentencing.\n\nId. (citation omitted).\n\f                                                                                      Scott–18\n\n       fool for that, but there is reason for that. Mr. Scott is a human being just like\n       anybody else. He deserves compassion just like anybody else. I saw what\n       he’s got, I saw what was put before you. A lot of [the] time I would have\n       come in here and been a lot harder on this police officer or objected during\n       the punishment phase of ya’ll [sic] seeing that stuff. But there is no way that\n       I can disguise his addiction. There is no way I can do that. It would be\n       foolish for me to try to put that over on you. But what you’re seeing in these\n       clips and what you are dealing with is a man who is mesmerized by\n       technology and by sex. And if you think that’s an isolated incident, you are\n       wrong. I’m going to get to that in just a second.\n\n                                       *       *       *\n\n       The thing that’s a problem with Orian is he has never been under any type\n       of supervision. Nobody has ever supervised him. In this state, we have\n       probation departments that look after these people on intensive supervision\n       and they can see them up to three times a week. They can monitor him. That\n       is his problem. That’s why we are here today, nobody has monitored his\n       addiction. He can get treated. He can get sex offender treatment.\n\n       The right to effective assistance of counsel encompasses closing arguments of the\n\ndefense. Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 6 (2003). Closing arguments involve\n\ninherently tactical decisions that must be tailored to the strategy of the defense based on\n\nevents that transpired during trial. Id. Accordingly, deference to counsel’s strategic\n\ndecisions during closing arguments is particularly important because of the wealth of\n\nlegitimate strategies that can be employed, and those decisions will be second-guessed\n\nonly if there is no plausible basis for the attorney’s actions. Id.\n\n       Scott argues that his counsel wrongfully implied that he had abused children\n\nbefore when he said, “if you think that’s an isolated incident, you are wrong.” We do not\n\nagree with Scott’s interpretation of the record. When counsel made the complained of\n\f                                                                                        Scott–19\n\ncomment, he was referring to his client being mesmerized by technology and sex, and the\n\nfact that many people are addicted to technology and sex. According to the defense, lots\n\nof people videotape sexual acts, including people in Paris17 and possibly even people the\n\njurors know. In making this argument, the defense sought to further its probation\n\nargument by putting Scott’s addictions into perspective as “not that bad” compared to the\n\nrest of the community and by arguing that his addiction could be controlled if he was\n\nplaced on probation. Because we do not agree with Scott’s interpretation of the record,\n\nand based on our own interpretation, we conclude that trial counsel was not deficient.\n\n                              2. State’s First Closing Argument\n\n       Next, Scott argues that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to\n\nnumerous allegedly improper parts of the State’s final argument. According to him, the\n\ncited arguments were not supported by the facts, were not reasonable deductions from the\n\nevidence, and were outside the record. Appropriate jury argument generally falls within\n\nonly four areas: (1) summation of the evidence; (2) reasonable deductions from the\n\nevidence; (3) answer to argument of opposing counsel; and (4) a plea for law\n\nenforcement. Freeman v. State, 340 S.W.3d 717, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n                                         a. First Claim\n\n       In the first excerpt, Scott complains that the State implied that he had abused other\n\n\n\n       17\n        Defense counsel told a story that his doctor was discovered to be a pedophile that\nrecorded children engaging in sexual acts. The doctor, he explained, was popular in the\ncommunity and was a Tom Selleck type.\n\f                                                                                            Scott–20\n\nboys and that his counsel was deficient for not objecting to that argument. The State\n\nargued that,\n\n       He has moved from state to state to state to state to state. He also worked as\n       a teacher. You heard him tell the boys that. That ought to scare the daylights\n       out of you. How many victims, how long of a trail of victims, has he left?\n       He had Beta tapes of himself having sex with other men, other males. And\n       you saw what his preference is.\n\nHere, the State suggested that, because Scott moved around a lot and worked as a teacher,\n\nhe may have victimized other male children. The record supports that Scott had moved\n\naround and had worked as a teacher for 40 years, so those arguments constitute a\n\nsummation of the evidence. However, the State’s implication that Scott may have left a\n\n“trail of victims” when he moved from state to state was improper.18\n\n       Even though the State’s argument was improper, that does not inexorably lead to\n\nthe conclusion that trial counsel was deficient for not objecting because counsel may have\n\nhad a strategic reason for not doing so.\n\n       Trial counsel does not specifically address his reasons for failing to object to this\n\nportion of the State’s argument, but the habeas court concluded that counsel may have\n\n\n       18\n            Dealing with a similar issue, we characterized the question as whether,\n\n       [T]he prosecutor’s reference to the ‘victims of other crimes’ and ‘the ones who\n       never come and tell you about it’ was an appeal to the jury to consider the impact\n       of their verdict on sexually abused children in general, or whether, the\n       prosecutor’s argument called on the jury to consider either the existence of other\n       adolescent victims of the appellant or to assess the appellant further punishment\n       because other children have been victimized.\n\nBorjan v. State, 787 S.W.2d 53, 57 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\n\f                                                                                      Scott–21\n\nmade a strategic decision not to object because that would have drawn the jury’s attention\n\nto the argument. Because we do not know the reasons counsel did not object to the State’s\n\nargument, we will examine the remainder of the record to determine whether any\n\nreasonable trial strategy could justify counsel’s conduct. Andrews, 159 S.W.3d at 102.\n\nThe record shows that trial counsel chose to respond to the State’s improper argument\n\nduring his closing, instead of objecting to the State’s argument during its closing. Counsel\n\ntold the jury that, even though the State was “portraying [Scott] as a predator and a child\n\nmolester,” “that is not what is front of you today.” He also stated that “[t]here is no\n\nevidence here that he ever touched [the victims] and there is no evidence here that he’s\n\never molested any children.” Scott’s trial counsel choice to respond to the State during his\n\nclosing argument, instead of objecting during the State’s initial closing argument, was a\n\nreasonable trial strategy.\n\n                                      b. Second Claim\n\n       Next, Scott complains that the State improperly argued that he did not call any\n\npunishment witnesses,\n\n       [Q]uite frankly, what’s most telling of all about his character is who has\n       come here to testify and tell you what a good person he is? If he was really\n       a saint, where are those people? Where is a former principle [sic], where is\n       a former neighbor, where is anybody to come and tell you something about\n       him? They are not here. That speaks volumes as to this man’s character.\n       That speaks volumes to the trail of victims that he’s left behind, and you\n       know that to be true.\n\n       Sometimes the State may permissibly argue that a defendant failed to call\n\f                                                                                         Scott–22\n\npunishment witnesses. In McKenzie v. State, 617 S.W.2d 211 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel\n\nOp.] 1981), the prosecution suggested that the defense could have called a number of\n\nwitnesses to testify on McKenzie’s behalf, like a minister to testify that McKenzie was\n\nstill welcome at church, a college classmate that would tell the jury that McKenzie is still\n\nhis friend, an employer who would say that McKenzie was welcome to return to his job,\n\nor a neighbor that would testify McKenzie would be welcomed back to the neighborhood.\n\nId. at 218–20. We held that those arguments were improper because there was no\n\nevidence that such witnesses existed or were available to testify. Id. at 221. On the other\n\nhand, in Mosley v. State, 686 S.W.2d 180, 183 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985), the State\n\nobserved that Mosley did not call any witnesses to rebut its argument that he had bad\n\ncharacter, “not a mother, not [a] father, not [a] brother, not [a] sister . . . .” We did not\n\nfind that argument to be improper because the State never speculated that such witnesses\n\nactually existed or about what they would have said had they been called to testify.\n\n       In this case, the State first referred to Scott’s general character and the fact that the\n\ndefense called no character witnesses. It then suggested that Scott could have called a\n\nprincipal from one of the many schools he taught at (Scott taught at a number of schools\n\nover a 40-year period) or a former neighbor to talk about his reputation before he was\n\narrested on child-abuse charges. It is clear from the context of the State’s entire argument\n\nthat the State was not referring to actual people, vis-à-vis, a specific principal or a specific\n\nneighbor or what such people would testify to. Rather, the inference the State urged the\n\f                                                                                         Scott–23\n\njury to draw was that, even though Scott had been a long-time educator who worked at\n\nvarious schools and had lived in various places, he did not call a single witness at the\n\npunishment phase to testify about his good character. Id. We also note that, unlike in\n\nMcKenzie, here the State did not speculate as to what specific character testimony any\n\npotential good-character witnesses would have given had one been called; whereas, in\n\nMcKenzie, the prosecutor suggested that a minister could have testified that McKenzie\n\nwas still welcome at church, a college classmate could have testified that McKenzie is\n\nstill his friend, an employer could testify that McKenzie was welcome to return to his job,\n\nor a neighbor could testify that McKenzie would be welcomed back to the neighborhood.\n\nBased on all of this, we conclude that counsel was not deficient because the State’s\n\nargument was permissible.\n\n                                       c. Third Claim\n\n       Scott also argues that his attorney was ineffective in failing to object to the\n\nfollowing portion of the State’s closing argument,\n\n       Ask yourself this one question, why did he come to your county, why did he\n       come to your community? The obvious answer is victims of opportunity.\n       There was a time here where you could open your door Saturday morning\n       and have your boy and girl go out and have fun, be back for\n       dinner . . . . Thanks to Mr. Scott and others like him, we can’t do\n       that . . . you always have to be on the lookout for the Mr. Scotts of the\n       world . . . . [W]e live in fear for what he will do to our kids. Or do you want\n       to take a stand and send not only him a message-make no mistake about it,\n       he certainly appears to be an elderly gentlemen. He may not have long to\n       live on this earth, but whether it’s two minutes or twenty years, he has been\n       here too long . . . if someone had done something 30 or 40 years ago, we\n       wouldn’t be here. But they didn’t.\n\f                                                                                     Scott–24\n\nConsidered in its entirety, we conclude that this was a permissible plea for law\n\nenforcement. It was not improper for the State to ask the jury to send a message to Scott\n\nand the community that his type of behavior, and that of other child predators, is\n\nunconscionable and will not be tolerated. Also, even if the State’s argument was\n\nimproper, we cannot say that counsel’s choice not to object was part of an unreasonable\n\ntrial strategy. The State had made a similar argument earlier in its closing, and defense\n\ncounsel responded to both arguments in his closing. Trial counsel’s choice to respond to\n\nthe State during his closing argument, instead of objecting during the State’s initial\n\nclosing argument, was a reasonable trial strategy.\n\n                             3. State’s Final Closing Argument\n\n       Scott also directs us to various excerpts from the State’s final closing argument\n\nthat he argues his counsel should have objected to. We address each contention in turn.\n\n                                       a. First Claim\n\n       Scott first complains about the following argument made by the State during final\n\nsummation,\n\n       Let me make this clear. If this man gets probation today, he gets up and he\n       walks out that door and he goes home and he lives in a house and he does\n       whatever he wants to do, other than the 30 minutes or so that he has to\n       report to a probation officer each week. Do you want that man back in our\n       community offending teenage boys again? Or do you want to send him to\n       Oklahoma to see his family to offend in Oklahoma or in Indiana? He came\n       here because the other states didn’t do anything, possibly. And look what he\n       did here. Probation is not the appropriate punishment in this case.\n\n       The State’s argument that Scott was able to abuse the victims because “the other\n\f                                                                                      Scott–25\n\nstates didn’t do anything, possibly,” was allegedly improper because it went outside of the\n\nrecord. The question is whether trial counsel was deficient when he failed to object to that\n\nallegedly improper argument. We conclude that he was not. The State made a similar\n\nargument during its initial closing, which the defense responded to. Objecting to the\n\nState’s argument again would have only drawn the jury’s attention to that argument. It\n\nalso could have undercut the defense’s strategy of Scott accepting responsibility for his\n\nbehavior and pleading for mercy from the jury.\n\n                                      b. Second Claim\n\n        Next, Scott contends that the State made an improper argument when it asserted\n\nthat,\n\n        He’s got this sexual addiction but we haven’t heard proof of that. The man\n        is a pedophile. He preys on young kids and takes advantage of them. He\n        wants to blame it on the [I]nternet. I don’t believe the [I]nternet was around\n        when Beta tapes[19] were invented, so we are not going to blame it on the\n        [I]nternet.\n\n        Scott complains that the State’s argument referring to him as a pedophile was\n\noutside of the record and not a fair deduction from the evidence. The habeas court\n\ndisagreed, concluding that counsel’s failure to object was reasonable because Scott could\n\nhave properly been characterized as a pedophile. We agree with the habeas court and\n\nadopt its conclusion. It is a fair deduction from the evidence that Scott is a pedophile. He\n\npled guilty to multiple counts of possession of child pornography, which was properly\n\n        19\n         Betamax tapes are a type of video cassette that were developed by Sony and were\nreleased in 1975.\n\f                                                                                         Scott–26\n\nbefore the jury, and the jury convicted him of three counts of inducing a sexual\n\nperformance by a child and promoting a sexual performance by a child.20 The State also\n\npresented evidence that Scott engaged in a pattern of grooming his victims and\n\nsurreptitiously recording them masturbating and that he was in possession of a substantial\n\namount of child pornography. Based on this, the State asked the jury to draw a reasonable\n\ndeduction from the evidence that Scott is sexually attracted to children.\n\n                                         c. Third Claim\n\n       Next, Scott argues that the following closing argument made by the State was\n\nimproper,\n\n       How long has he been taking photographs of young kids? How long has he\n       moved from state to state to state to lure in and throw out that net for 14 and\n       15 year old boys? It’s not an [I]nternet addiction, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n       The evidence shows that Scott was a teacher who had lived in various places. It\n\nalso showed that he had photographs in a shoe box of young children and that he lured in\n\nthe young victims in this case by grooming them. From the context of the State’s\n\nargument, it appears that it was asking the jury to infer that Scott may have tried to groom\n\nother children. Even if it did, that argument was not a reasonable deduction from the\n\nevidence, and it went outside of the record because there is no evidence to support that\n\nproposition. However, we do not believe that counsel was deficient. As we have noted,\n\n\n       20\n         Scott argues that the pedophile comment was improper because pedophilia is a\npsychiatric disorder and that the evidence does not support such a diagnosis. However, the State\nwas not portraying Scott as a person diagnosed with pedophilia; rather, it was arguing that Scott\nwas sexually attracted to children based on the evidence.\n\f                                                                                      Scott–27\n\nthe defense had already responded to a similar argument and repeatedly objecting to the\n\nState’s argument would have served only to draw the jury’s attention to argument.\n\n                            d. Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Claims\n\n      Scott’s next claims stem from the following excerpt,\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: What was Mr. Scott’s intent? Do you think it was just to\n      get these boys in there and photograph them and do nothing else? That’s so\n      far from the truth. As soon as he moved here, he threw out the bait, threw\n      out the net; by the way, the teenage boys is what I need. And he got them.\n             [Defense counsel] told you in opening statement that this was a sick\n      old man, been going on five years. He didn’t mean that he was physically\n      sick. He meant that he was a pervert and has been a pervert all of his life.\n      That’s what he is. That’s what he is. I hate to be that -- use those kinds of\n      descriptions, but that’s the fact of the matter.\n             Now, think about what would have happened if this had continued\n      on. There is no question that these boys would have been sexually assaulted.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Your Honor, I’m going to object. That misstates the evidence\n      and it’s beyond the scope of the evidence.\n\n      [COURT]: I think it’s a fair assumption based on the record. The objection\n      is overruled.\n\n      [PROSECUTOR]: Look at the photographs, [not] just the five that were\n      introduced. Look what he has. Look at the thousands and consider the\n      thousands and thousands of images. Look at the videotapes that he’s kept\n      for himself having sex with a male for 25, 30 years. What do you think is\n      going to happen?\n             Look at the fact that he was in San Antonio not too long ago, hires a\n      male prostitute to come see him, videotapes that action and then discusses\n      [I]nternet pornography sites, child pornography sit[es] with this prostitute.\n      What does that tell you? Now, I think we need to be thankful that none of\n      that got that far, but what he’s facing here now is just as serious.\n             How do we know that the tapes that he made aren’t out there? He\n      had the capabilities in his bedroom to take one and record it. How do we\n      know that he didn’t sell that to this sea of people that exists? Think about\n      that.\n\f                                                                                          Scott–28\n\n                                           i. Fourth Claim\n\n       First, Scott argues that the prosecutor’s argument speculating as to his intent and\n\nwhether his deviant behavior would continue to escalate was outside of the record.\n\nHowever, even if that argument was outside of the record, defense counsel objected to it.\n\nAnd, although counsel could have also asked for a curative instruction or requested a\n\nmistrial, such actions would have been futile given that the judge overruled his objection.\n\n                                            ii. Fifth Claim\n\n       Next, Scott claims that the State crossed the line when it told the jury to consider,\n\nnot only the five photographs admitted into evidence, but also the “thousands and\n\nthousands of images” police seized. We disagree. The argument was a proper summation\n\nof the evidence. Five images were admitted into evidence, and it was agreed that those\n\nfive images were just a representative sample of all of the images seized from Scott.21\n\nEven though only a few pictures were admitted into evidence, the jury was allowed to\n\nconsider all of the admitted evidence, including the testimony of Rhodes, who said that\n\npolice seized several CDs, DVDs, and 400 floppy disks containing pornography. He also\n\n\n       21\n            The State said as much in its closing arguments,\n\n       Good morning. First of all, I want to talk about the evidence that we have\n       introduced. We brought to you what we felt was sufficient for you to have a good\n       idea what it is. I apologize if you felt like we should have brought you every DVD\n       and showed you the thousands of images, but I didn’t want to do that. After\n       watching those movies yesterday, I didn’t think you did either. I think you have an\n       idea after listening to testimony as to what was in that material, and after looking\n       at those five photographs as being representative as to what the defendant had on\n       his computer.\n\f                                                                                         Scott–29\n\ntestified that police found thousands of pornographic images on Scott’s computer and a\n\nshoe box filled with pictures of boys swimming in a pool at what looked like a party.\n\nDefense counsel was not deficient in failing to object to proper argument by the State.\n\n                                        iii. Sixth Claim\n\n       Finally, Scott argues that the State’s suggestion that he may have released or sold\n\nthe pictures or videos in his possession over the Internet was improper.22 We agree that\n\nthe argument was outside of the record. Although there was evidence that Scott\n\ndownloaded many of the images that were seized and that he frequented child\n\npornography websites, there was no evidence that he bought or sold child pornography.\n\nThe question then is whether defense counsel’s failure to object was a reasonable choice\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances as they existed at trial.\n\n       Because the record is devoid of any reasons for counsel’s failure to object, we\n\nreview it to determine whether counsel’s conduct was so outrageous that no competent\n\nattorney would have engaged in it. Andrews, 159 S.W.3d at 102–03. Here, it is\n\nconceivable that counsel made a reasonable strategic decision not to object to the State’s\n\nargument. The strategy was to implore the jury to be merciful and place Scott on\n\nprobation. Counsel could have reasonably believed that such objections would undercut\n\nthe defense’s plea for leniency. Counsel’s failure to object was not so outrageous that no\n\n\n\n       22\n         The habeas court found that the State never suggested that Scott sold the videotapes of\nthe boys showering over the Internet, but that finding is not supported by the record, and we do\nnot adopt it.\n\f                                                                                         Scott–30\n\ncompetent attorney would have engaged in it.23\n\n                                       D. Improper Comment\n\n       In Scott’s final claim, he argues that his counsel was deficient when he failed to\n\nobject to the trial judge’s comment that it was “a fair assumption based on the record”\n\nthat Scott would have eventually sexually assaulted the boys. He also asserts that counsel\n\nwas deficient because he did not request a mistrial. The habeas court concluded that\n\ndefense counsel may have made a strategic choice not to object because doing so would\n\nonly draw the jury’s attention to the judge’s comment.\n\n       “The trial judge shall maintain an attitude of impartiality throughout the trial.”\n\nLagrone v. State, 209 S.W. 411, 415 (1919). The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nstates that the judge shall not, “at any stage of the proceeding previous to the return of the\n\nverdict, make any remark calculated to convey to the jury his opinion of the case.” T EX.\n\nC ODE C RIM. P ROC. art. 38.05. When a trial judge does make a comment on the weight of\n\nthe evidence, it constitutes reversible error only if the comment was “reasonably\n\ncalculated to prejudice the defendant’s rights.” Sharpe v. State, 648 S.W.2d 705, 706\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1983). Scott argues that the judge’s statement was a comment on the\n\nweight of the evidence because it showed the judge’s belief that, based on the evidence,\n\n\n       23\n            In his supplemental affidavit, defense counsel said that,\n\n       During the trial, I regularly watched the jurors to gauge their emotions and\n       reactions. It was obvious to me that hearing the teenage boys testify, watching the\n       videos admitted into evidence of them masturbating in a curtainless shower and\n       watching Mr. Scott simulate masturbation was repulsive to each and every juror.\n\f                                                                                      Scott–31\n\nScott would have eventually sexually assaulted the boys. He also asserts that the comment\n\nwas reasonably calculated to injure his rights because the judge’s comment bolstered the\n\nState’s argument that Scott was not deserving of a lesser sentence. According to him, this\n\nis especially evident in light of the fact that the jury assessed the maximum punishment\n\nand the judge stacked his sentences.\n\n       It is a close call whether the judge made an improper comment on the weight of\n\nthe evidence because the meaning of the comment is not clear. On the one hand, the\n\njudge’s response could have meant that the State’s argument was proper because it was a\n\nreasonable deduction from the evidence, which is a proper area of closing argument. On\n\nthe other hand, the judge’s comment could be read to mean that he was approving of the\n\nState’s view of the evidence, which would be an improper comment.\n\n       In his affidavits, trial counsel does not specifically address his reasons for not\n\nobjecting, but even if we assume that the judge’s comment was improper, trial counsel\n\nwas not deficient. Directly preceding the judge’s comment, the defense had just objected\n\nto the State’s argument. Counsel may have believed that it was unlikely that the judge,\n\nwho had just overruled counsel’s objection, would have sustained a defense objection that\n\nhe commented on the weight of the evidence. Counsel also may have believed that it was\n\nbest not to draw the jury’s attention to the judge’s comment or to the State’s improper\n\nargument. At any rate, we cannot say that counsel’s conduct was so outrageous that no\n\ncompetent attorney would have engaged in it.\n\f                                                                                  Scott–32\n\n                                       E. Prejudice\n\n       The habeas court concluded that Scott was not prejudiced because the evidence of\n\nguilt was overwhelming. We need not address the issue, however, having already\n\nconcluded that trial counsel performed effectively.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Because Scott has not proven that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at\n\nthe punishment phase of his trial, we deny relief.\n\nDelivered: October 18, 2017\n\nPublish\n\f", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a sheet-supplying device employed in an image-forming device.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nSheet-supplying devices using air suction are well known in the art as sheet-supplying devices used in printers, photocopiers, and other image-forming devices. FIG. 1 illustrates the function of a sheet-supplying device 101 of this type. As shown in FIG. 1, the sheet-supplying device 101 includes a sheet-accommodating tray 111 and a sheet-feeding device 112 disposed above the sheet-accommodating tray 111. The sheet-feeding device 112 includes a sheet-feeding belt 112C and an air suction device 113. A plurality of sheets 102 is stacked on top of the sheet-accommodating tray 111. The sheet 102 positioned on the top of the stack is referred to as a topmost sheet 102A. When the air suction device 113 draws the topmost sheet 102A up to the sheet-feeding belt 112C, the sheet-feeding belt 112C conveys the topmost sheet 102A to a prescribed position.\nAn air-jetting device 114 is disposed on the front side of the sheet-accommodating tray 111, that is, on the left side in FIG. 1. The air-jetting device 114 blows a jet of air onto one end of the sheets 102, causing a few sheets 102 stacked on the sheet-accommodating tray 111 to float and separate. A position sensor 116 is disposed on the other end of the sheets 102, which end is unaffected by the air blown from the air-jetting device 114 and does not float. The position sensor 116 includes a digital sensor 116A and a surface position-detecting lever 116B. A raising/lowering device (not shown) is connected to the sheet-accommodating tray 111 and is capable of raising and lowering the same. The raising/lowering device raises the sheet-accommodating tray 111 until the topmost sheet 102A contacts the surface position-detecting lever 116B. At this time, the surface position-detecting lever 116B is displaced vertically upward, enabling the position sensor 116 to detect the position of other end of the topmost sheet 102A based on the position of the surface position-detecting lever 116B.\nA plurality of suction holes (not shown) is formed over the entire surface of the sheet-feeding belt 112C. By means of these suction holes and the air suction device 113, sheets can be drawn to and conveyed by the sheet-feeding belt 112C.\nNext, steps in a control process of the controlling device (not shown) for controlling operations of this conventional sheet-supplying device will be described with reference to the flowchart in FIG. 2. A controller (not shown) monitors whether the position sensor 116 has detected that the topmost sheet 102A has contacted the surface position-detecting lever 116B (S101). If the position sensor 116 has not detected this contact (S101: NO), the controller raises the sheet-accommodating tray 111 (S102), and then the controller monitors again whether the position sensor 116 has detected this contact (S101). When the position sensor 116 detects that the topmost sheet 102A has contacted the surface position-detecting lever 116B (S101: YES), then the controller judges whether the sheet-accommodating tray 111 has stopped (S103)\nWhen the sheet-accommodating tray 111 has not stopped (S103: NO), the controller stops the raising of the sheet-accommodating tray 111 (S104). Then, the controller controls the air-jetting device 114 to blow air onto the one end of the sheets 102 stacked on the sheet-accommodating tray 111 and the air suction device 113 to draw air (S105).\nThe air blown from the air-jetting device 114 floats and separates a few of the top sheets 102. The topmost sheet 102A that is among the separated sheets 102 is drawn to the sheet-feeding belt 112C by the air suction device 113. The topmost sheet 102A that has been drawn to the sheet-feeding belt 112C is conveyed to a prescribed position by the rotation of the sheet-feeding belt 112C. When the topmost sheet 102A has been conveyed in this way, the controller repeats S101-S105 with respect to the following topmost sheet 102A.\nBy the way, when the number of sheets 102 stacked on the sheet-accommodating tray 111 decreases and the vertical position of the topmost sheet 102A becomes lower. Then, the topmost sheet 102A cannot be detected by the position sensor 116 (S101: NO). In such a case, the controller raises the sheet-accommodating tray 111 (S102). On the other hand, when the number of sheets 102 has not likely decreased by much and the vertical position of the topmost sheet 102A has not dropped that much, the topmost sheet 102A is detected soon by the position sensor 116 (S101: YES).\nJapanese unexamined patent application publication No. HEI-7-187422 discloses a sheet-supplying device that can adjust the position and angle of the jetted air based on the vertical position of the topmost sheet. Accordingly, this sheet-supplying device can separate floating sheets from one another, even when the sheets have a tendency to curl.\nJapanese unexamined patent application publication No. HEI-7-89625 discloses a sheet-supplying device 201 as shown in FIG. 3 that includes an air-jetting device 214 for blowing a jet of air, and a reflecting type distance-measuring sensor 215 for measuring part of a topmost sheet 202A that is floated by air blown from the air-jetting device 214. With this construction, the sheet-supplying device 201 can adjust the amount of jetted air from the air-jetting device 214 based on the vertical position of the topmost sheet 202A measured by the reflecting type distance-measuring sensor 215.\nHowever, when there is a curl in the sheets, the vertical position of the topmost sheet differs between its front end and rear end, that is, between the left and right ends in FIG. 1. Since the conventional sheet-supplying devices as shown in FIG. 1 use a position sensor to detect only the position of the sheet at the rear end thereof, the front end of the topmost sheet may not be in an optimal position for being drawn to and conveyed by the sheet-feeding device, even if the vertical position of the topmost sheet at the rear end thereof is in the optimal position. This may result in such problems as a plurality of sheets being fed simultaneously in the sheet-feeding operation or the feeding belt being unable to draw the topmost sheet by air suction and therefore failing to feed the sheet.\nFurther, although the sheet-supplying device disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. HEI-7-187422 can adjust the position and angle of the jetted air based on the vertical position of the topmost sheet, this construction is complex and increases the manufacturing costs of the device. Further, since the optimal vertical position of the topmost sheet for pickup by air suction differs based on the sheet weight and quality, feeding failures and the feeding of multiple sheets simultaneously may occur when different types of sheets are used.\nThe sheet-supplying device disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. HEI-7-89625 uses a reflective type distance-measuring sensor to measure the vertical position of the topmost sheet on the end of the sheet that is floating and fluttering by the jetted air. Such measurements are unreliable and do not produce accurate values. Therefore, this device cannot reliably output an optimal volume of air.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Upon electronic excitation (λmax ∼ 300 nm), (2,6-aza)Ind undergoes N(1)-H to N(6) long-distance proton transfer in neutral H2O, resulting in normal (340 nm) and proton-transfer tautomer (480 nm) emissions with an overall quantum yield of 0.25. The rate of the water-catalyzed proton transfer shows a prominent H/D kinetic isotope effect, which is determined to be 8.3 × 108 s-1 and 4.7 × 108 s-1 in H2O and D2O, respectively. Proton inventory experiments indicate the involvement of two water molecules and three protons, which undergo a relay type of excited-state triple proton transfer (ESTPT) in a concerted, asynchronous manner.

{"text": "Estrogens interact in a variety of ways with the liver. Not only is the liver an estrogen-responsive tissue, but it is also responsible for the interconversion, metabolism and excretion of the estrogens. The effect of liver disease on these processes has not been studied well, except in the specific case of alcohol-induced liver disease. Therefore, using five well-characterized animal models of liver diseases, we will assess the effect of a variety of liver diseases on several aspects of estrogen metabolism in the male rat. First, the potential responsiveness of the liver to estrogens will be evaluated by quantitation of cytosolic receptors in both the diseased and normal livers as well as by determination of the affinity of the receptors for estrogen. Second, we will assess changes in the levels and/or affinity of male-specific estrogen binding protein whose proposed role is that of an estrogen scavenger. Third, the synthesis and tissue levels of the catechol estrogens (2-hydroxy estrogens) will be examined in rats with diseased and normal livers. These compounds are of interest because they are major metabolites of the estrogens in the liver, and, additionally, because they have been shown to interfere with P-450-related drug metabolism in the liver. Therefore, since alterations in any one of these various aspects of hepatic estrogen metabolism could adversely effect individuals with liver disease, an evaluation of various types of liver disease on these individual processes should be meaningful. Moreover, this study should provide a basis for the understanding of the effect of specific types of liver disease upon various aspects of estrogen metabolism and thus the effect of such alterations upon the individual.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to a mobile harbor crane for the combined handling of containers and bulk materials, having an undercarriage and an upper carriage, which is mounted rotatably on the base frame of the undercarriage and on which a tower with a boom that can be pivoted about a horizontal axis is arranged.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nIn the standard version, mobile harbor cranes of the type described above are designed for quays that allow relatively high axle loads of about 60 t/axle and surface loads of about 50 to 60 t/sq m under supporting plates provided.\nFor specific customers, the axle loads or surface loads can be reduced, if appropriate, by using additional axles and larger supporting plates.\nIn many parts of the world, however, the above measures on existing mobile harbor cranes are not technically feasible or adequate because the quays are extremely old. Even the construction of more modem quays, where standard concrete components used for building road bridges are generally employed, often allows only relatively low axle and surface loads.\nIt is the object of the present invention to design a mobile harbor crane for combined handling of containers and bulk materials in such a way that the mobile handling apparatus can be used with significantly reduced supporting loads for loading and unloading ships, even in seaports and inland harbors where the quays are not capable of taking the supporting loads of standard mobile harbor cranes.\nTo achieve the object, four support beams are connected pivotally to the base frame of the undercarriage, symmetrically to the longitudinal and transverse axes of the vehicle, in such a way that they can each be pivoted about vertical axes. The support beams are provided at their free ends with vertically acting leveling cylinders, by means of which the support beams are supported on the wheels of a plurality of traveling gear assemblies via balancers for uniform distribution of the supporting forces.\nThe mobile harbor crane according to the invention provides a new type of handling apparatus that is extremely mobile and flexible in application. There are no additional costs compared with a mobile harbor crane adapted specifically to customer requirements. Nevertheless, the balancer system ensures a uniform axle load matched to permitted quay loads and does so both in the transportation position and in the working position of the machine. Additional enlarged supporting plates are no longer required since the pedestal-like base frame of the undercarriage serves as a mounting for the four supporting beams, which transmit the supporting forces of the mobile harbor crane into the traveling gear assemblies via the balancers. At the same time, the traveling gear has a minimum support base during the transportation of the machine and a maximum support base when being used for work because the supporting beams can be pivoted into the working and transportation positions.\nIn a further refinement of the invention, it is envisaged that between the base frame and the balancer of each traveling gear assembly there is a coupling rod that forms a parallelogram linkage with the support beam and by means of which the traveling gear assembly can be adjusted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle in any pivoted position of the support beams. During and after the pivoting of the support beams, the coupling rods ensure that the wheels of all the traveling gear assemblies adopt a basic position in which they point in the same direction, namely in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, irrespective of the size of the pivoting angle of the support beams.\nTo obtain stable conditions in the working position and in the transportation position, provision is made, according to a further feature of the invention, for the support beams to be capable of being fixed both in their extended working position and in their retracted transportation position by means of telescoping locking devices, which are arranged between the base frame and the free end of the support beams.\nThe support beams are adjusted with means belonging to the traveling gear itself since, according to another feature of the invention, it is proposed that to adjust the support beams between the transportation position and the working position, the axles of the traveling gear assemblies, which axles are pivotable through xc2x190xc2x0, can be adjusted under computer control and in a monitored manner on a common steering column, and the pivoting movements of the support beams can be performed by actuating the traveling gear drives. The position of the axles during this process is monitored by means of angular resolvers and pivoting takes place automatically in such a way that all the axles turn in the direction of the center of the machine (center of the rotary joint), for example. In this way, the support beams can be pivoted without additional hydraulic cylinders or similar devices.\nThe position of the axles (together with the wheels) is controlled by detectors of a control unit so that the alignment of all the wheels corresponds to the direction the crane will be moved. For example, if the crane moves straight ahead, all axles are oriented in parallel. To follow a curve, the axles are oriented so that the wheels follow an arc.\nSince quays are often only relatively narrow and, after subtracting the necessary truck lane from the width of the quay, leave insufficient standing room to set up a standard-type mobile harbor crane with the required load capacity, the vehicular crane according to the invention offers, according to another feature of the invention, a free space in the longitudinal direction of the mobile harbor crane, between the traveling gear assemblies of the latter, to allow transportation vehicles to drive under the mobile harbor crane.\nBecause the mobile harbor crane according to the invention no longer requires separate support, the traveling gear that simultaneously serves as a support must be appropriately vibration-damped. To achieve this, the proposal is made, according to another feature of the invention, that the traveling gear assemblies of the mobile harbor crane have tires and, to damp vibration of the machine, the tires of the wheels are about 75% full of water. The vibration-damping effect of this measure is desired particularly when the machine is in the working position. Antifreeze is added to the water in the tires if required.\nThe invention provides a flexible and mobile handling apparatus that can be used cost-effectively and hence economically even on narrow quays where the subgrade is not very strong.\nAn exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is described below.\nOther objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nOne of the outstanding problems in interdisciplinary science is nonlinear and complex systems identification, prediction and control. Given a complex dynamical system, the various types of dynamical processes are of great interest. The ultimate goal in the study of complex systems is to devise practically implementable strategies to control the collective dynamics. A great challenge is that the network structure and the nodal dynamics are often unknown but only limited measured time series are available. To control the system dynamics, it is imperative to be able to map out the system details from data. Reconstructing complex network structure and dynamics from data, the inverse problem, has thus become a central issue in contemporary network science and engineering^[@CR1],[@CR2],[@CR3],[@CR4],[@CR5],[@CR6],[@CR7],[@CR8]^. There are broad applications of the solutions of the network reconstruction problem, due to the ubiquity of complex interacting patterns arising from many systems in a variety of disciplines^[@CR9],[@CR10],[@CR11],[@CR12]^.\n\nAn important class of collective dynamics is epidemic spreading and information diffusion in the human society or on computer networks^[@CR13],[@CR14],[@CR15],[@CR16],[@CR17],[@CR18],[@CR19],[@CR20]^. The past decades have witnessed severe epidemic outbreaks at the global scale due to the mutation of virus, including SARS^[@CR21],[@CR22]^, H5N1 (refs [@CR23], [@CR24]), H1N1 (refs [@CR25], [@CR26]) and the recent invasion of H7N9 in eastern China^[@CR27],[@CR28]^. Our goal is to reconstruct the networks hosting the spreading process and identify the source of spreading using limited measurements. This is especially challenging due to (1) difficulty in predicting and monitoring mutations of deadly virus and (2) absence of epidemic threshold in heterogeneous networks^[@CR29],[@CR30],[@CR31],[@CR32]^. Another example is rumour propagation in the online virtual communities, which can cause financial loss or even social instabilities, such as the 2011 irrational and panicked acquisition of salt in southeast Asian countries caused by the nuclear leak in Japan. In this regard, identifying the propagation network for controlling the dynamics is of great interest. Another significant challenge in reconstructing a spreading network lies in the nature of the available time series: they are polarized, despite stochastic spreading among nodes. Indeed, the link pattern and the probability of infection are encrypted in the binary status of individuals, infected or not, analogous to the collapse of wave function to one associated with some discrete quantum state induced by observation in quantum mechanics.\n\nThere have been recent efforts in addressing the inverse problem of some special types of complex propagation networks^[@CR33],[@CR34]^. In particular, for diffusion process originated from a single source, the routes of diffusion from the source constitute a tree-like structure. If information about the early stage of the spreading dynamics is available, it would be feasible to decode all branches that reveal the connections from the source to its neighbours, and then to their neighbours and so on. Taking into account the time delays in the diffusion process enables a straightforward inference of the source in a complex network through enumerating all possible hierarchical trees^[@CR33],[@CR34]^. However, if no immediate information about the diffusion is available, the tree-structure-based inference method is inapplicable, and the problem of network reconstruction and locating the source becomes extremely challenging, hindering control of diffusion and delivery of immunization. The loss of knowledge about the source is common in real situations. For example, passengers on an international flight can carry a highly contagious disease, making certain airports the immediate neighbours of the hidden source, which would be difficult to trace. In another example, the source could be migratory birds coming from other countries or continents. A general data-driven approach, applicable in such scenarios, is still lacking.\n\nIn this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework to reconstruct complex propagation networks from time series based on the compressed sensing theory (CST)^[@CR35],[@CR36],[@CR37],[@CR38],[@CR39],[@CR40]^, a novel optimization paradigm for sparse-signal reconstruction with broad applications in signal and image processing. Owing to the striking characteristics of CST such as the extremely low data requirement and rigorous guarantee of convergence to optimal solutions, our framework is highly efficient and accurate. However, casting the inverse problem into the CST framework is highly non-trivial. Although CST has been used to uncover the nodal interaction patterns for coupled oscillator networks or evolutionary games from time series^[@CR41],[@CR42],[@CR43]^, the dynamics of epidemic propagation is typically highly stochastic with, for example, binary time series, rendering inapplicable the existing CST-based formulation. Further, despite the alternative sparsity enforcing regularizers and convex optimization used in ref. [@CR44] to infer networks, CST has not been applied to reconstructing propagation networks, especially when the available time series are binary. The main accomplishment of this work is then the development of a scheme to implement the highly non-trivial transformation associated with the spreading dynamics in the paradigm of CST. Without loss of generality, we employ two prototypical models of epidemic spreading: classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics^[@CR13]^ and contact processes (CPs)^[@CR45],[@CR46]^, on both model and real-world (empirical) networks. Inhomogeneous infection and recovery rates as representative characteristics of the natural diversity are incorporated into the diffusion dynamics to better mimic the real-world situation. We assume that only binary time series can be measured, which characterize the status of any node, infected or susceptible, at any time after the outbreak of the epidemic. The source that triggers the spreading process is assumed to be externally inaccessible (hidden). In fact, one may not even realize its existence from available time series. Our method enables, based on relatively small amounts of data, a full reconstruction of the epidemic spreading network with nodal diversity and successful identification of the immediate neighbouring nodes of the hidden source (thereby ascertaining its existence and uniquely specifying its connections to nodes in the network). The framework is validated with respect to different amounts of data generated from various combinations of the network structures and dynamical processes. High accuracy, high efficiency and applicability in a strongly stochastic environment with measurement noise and missing information are the most striking characteristics of our framework. Thus, broad applications can be expected in addressing significant problems such as targeted control of disease and rumour spreading.\n\nResults {#Sec2}\n=======\n\nCompressed sensing {#Sec3}\n------------------\n\nThe general problem that CST addresses is to reconstruct a vector **X**ε*R*^*N*^ from linear measurements **Y** about **X** in the form\n\nwhere **Y**ε*R*^*M*^ and **Φ** is an *M × N* matrix. The striking feature of CS is that the number of measurements can be much less than the number of components of the unknown vector, that is, *M*\\<\\<*N*, insofar as **X** is sparse and the number of non-zero components in it is less than *M*. Accurate reconstruction can be achieved by solving the following convex-optimization problem^[@CR35]^:\n\nwhere is the *L*~1~ norm of **X** and the matrix **Φ** satisfies the restricted isometry property. Solutions to the convex optimization are now standard^[@CR35],[@CR36],[@CR37],[@CR38],[@CR39],[@CR40]^. (More details of the CST can be found in [Supplementary Note 1](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}.) Our goal is to develop a framework to cast the problem of reconstructing propagation networks into form (1).\n\nReconstruction framework {#Sec4}\n------------------------\n\nTo present our framework in a transparent manner, we first consider the relatively simple case where there is no hidden source. Further, we assume that the disease starts to propagate from a fraction of the infected nodes. As we will see, based on this framework, it is feasible to locate any hidden source based solely on time series after outbreak of infection. The state of an arbitrary node *i* is denoted as *S*~*i*~, where\n\nOwing to the characteristic difference between the SIS dynamics and CP, we treat them separately (see Methods).\n\nFor the SIS dynamics, the probability of an arbitrary node *i* being infected by its neighbors at time *t* is\n\nwhere *λ*~*i*~ is the infection rate of *i*, *a*~*ij*~ stands for the elements of the adjacency matrix (*a*~*ij*~=1 if *i* connects to *j* and *a*~*ij*~=0 otherwise), *S*~*j*~(*t*) is the state of node *j* at *t*, and the superscript 01 denotes the change from susceptible state (0) to infected state (1). At the same time, the recovery probability of *i* is , where δ~*i*~ is the recovery rate of node *i* and the superscript 10 denotes the transition from infected state to susceptible state. Equation (4) can be rewritten as\n\nIf measurements at different times *t*=*t*~1~, *t*~2~, ···, *t*~*m*~ are available, equation (5) can be written in the matrix form **Y**~*m*\\ ×\\ 1~=**Φ**~m\\ ×\\ (*N*−1)~·**X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~, where **Y** contains at different *t*, **Φ** is determined by the state *S*~*j*~(*t*) of nodes except *i*, and **X** comprising the links and infection rates of *i* is sparse for a general network (see Methods). The main challenge here is that the infection probabilities at different times are not given directly from the time series of the nodal state.\n\nTo develop a method to estimate the probability from the nodal states, we set a threshold Δ pertaining to the normalized Hamming distance between strings composed of *S*~*j*~(*t*) (*j≠i*) at different *t* to identify a base string at and a set of strings subject to the base. According to the law of large numbers, the probability can be estimated by the average over the state *S*~*i*~(*t*+1) at all proper time. By setting another threshold Θ associated with the normalized Hamming distance, we can identify a set of base strings. This process finally gives rise to a set of reconstruction equations in the matrix form:\n\nwhere correspond to the time associated with *m* base strings and ‹·› denote the average over all satisfied *t* (see Methods). The vector **Y**~*m*\\ ×\\ 1~ and the matrix **Φ**~*m*\\ ×\\ (*N*−1)~ can then be obtained based solely on time series of nodal states and the vector **X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~ to be reconstructed is sparse, rendering applicable the CS framework. As a result, we can achieve exact reconstruction of all neighbours of node *i* from relatively small amounts of observation. In a similar manner the neighbouring vectors of all other nodes can be uncovered from time series, enabling a full reconstruction of the whole network by matching the neighboring sets of all nodes.\n\nFor the CP dynamics, the infection probability of an arbitrary node *i* is given by\n\nwhere *k*~*i*~ is the degree of the node *i*, and the recovery probability is (see Methods). In close analogy to the SIS dynamics, we have\n\nWe then choose a series of base strings using a proper threshold Θ to establish a set of equations, expressed in the matrix form **Y**~*m*\\ ×\\ 1~=**Φ**~*m*\\ ×\\ (*N*−1)~·**X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~ (see [Supplementary Note 2](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}), where **Φ** has the same form as in equation (6), but **Y** and **X** are given by\n\nOur reconstruction framework based on establishing the vector **Y** and the matrix **Φ** is schematically illustrated in [Fig. 1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. It is noteworthy that our framework can be extended to directed networks in a straightforward manner due to the feature that the neighbouring set of each node can be independently reconstructed. For instance, the neighbouring vector **X** can be defined to represent a unique link direction, for example, incoming links. Inference of the directed links of all nodes yields the full topology of the entire directed network.Figure 1Schematic illustration of building up Y and Φ from binary time series.(**a**) Fourteen snapshots of data at time instants *t*~1~−*t*~14~ of eight nodes in a sample network, where *S*~*i*~ is the time series of node 2 and *S*~−*i*~ denotes the strings of other nodes at different times. The neighbourhood of node 2 is to be reconstructed. Only the pairs 00 and 01 in the time series of *S*~*i*~ (*i*=2) and the corresponding *S*~−*i*~ contain useful information about the network, as marked by different colours. (**b**) As *S*~*i*~(*t*+1) is determined by the neighbours of *i* and *S*~−*i*~(*t*), we sort out *S*~*i*~(*t*+1) and *S*~−*i*~(*t*) in the coloured sections of the time series in **a**. According to the threshold parameters *Δ*=3/7 and Θ=3/7, we calculate the normalized Hamming distance between each pair of strings *S*~−*i*~(*t*), finding two base strings at and with . We separate the coloured strings into two groups that are led by the two base strings, respectively. In each group, the normalized Hamming distance between the base string and other strings is calculated and the difference from in each string is marked by red. Using parameter *Δ*, in the group led by , *S*~−*i*~(*t*~5~) and *S*~*i*~(*t*~6~) are preserved, because of . In contrast, *S*~−*i*~(*t*~7~) and *S*~*i*~(*t*~8~) are disregarded because . In the group led by , due to , the string is preserved. The two sets of remaining strings marked by purple and green can be used to yield the quantities required by the reconstruction formula. (Note that different base strings are allowed to share some strings, but for simplicity, this situation is not illustrated here. See [Supplementary Note 3](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} for a detailed discussion.) (**c**) The average values and used to extract the vector **Y** and the matrix **Φ** in the reconstruction formula, where , , and based on the remaining strings marked in different colours (see Methods for more details). CST can be used to reconstruct the neighbouring vector **X** of node 2 from **Y** and **Φ** from **Y**=**Φ·X**.\n\nReconstructing networks and infection and recovery rates {#Sec5}\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo quantify the performance of our method in terms of the number of base strings (equations) for a variety of diffusion dynamics and network structures, we study the success rates for existent links (SRELs) and null connections (SRNCs), corresponding to non-zero and zero element values in the adjacency matrix, respectively. We impose the strict criterion that the network is regarded to have been fully reconstructed if and only if both success rates reach 100%. The sparsity of links makes it necessary to define SREL and SRNC separately. As the reconstruction method is implemented for each node in the network, we define SREL and SRNC on the basis of each individual node and the two success rates for the entire network are the respective averaged values over all nodes. We also consider the issue of trade-off in terms of the true positive rate (for correctly inferred links) and the false positive rate (for incorrectly inferred links).\n\nHere we assume that there is no hidden source and the spreading process starts from a fraction of infected nodes, and record the binary time series. [Figure 2a](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the reconstructed values of the components of the neighbouring vector **X** of all nodes. Let be the number of base strings normalized by the network size *N*. For small values of , for example, , the values of elements associated with links and that associated with null connections (actual zeros in the adjacency matrix) overlap, leading to ambiguities in the identification of links. In contrast, for larger values of , for example, , an apparent gap emerges between the two groups of element values, enabling us to correctly identify all links by simply setting a cut-off within the gap (see [Supplementary Fig. 1a](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 4](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} for a method to set the cut-off). The success rates (SREL and SRNC) as a function of for SIS and CP on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are shown in [Fig. 2b,c](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, where we observe nearly perfect reconstruction of links insofar as exceeds a relatively small value---an advantage of compressed sensing. The exact reconstruction is robust in the sense that a wide range of values can yield nearly 100% success rates. Our reconstruction method is then effective for tackling real networks in the absence of any *a priori* knowledge about its topology. In particular, the existence of a clear gap in the reconstructed vector **X** represents a successful reconstruction for a real network.Figure 2Network reconstruction performance.(**a**) Element values ln(1−λ~*i*~)*a*~*ij*~ of vector **X** times −1 for different fraction of base strings for SIS dynamics. (**b**,**c**) Success rate (SREL and SRNC) and conflict rate (CR) of reconstruction as a function of for SIS dynamics on Newman--Watts (NW) small-world networks (**b**) and CP dynamics on Erdös--Rényi (ER) random networks (**c**). For the SIS dynamics, the parameters are Θ=0.25, *Δ*=0.45 and the infection and recovery rates *λ*~*i*~ and *δ*~*i*~ are randomly distributed in the ranges (0.2, 0.4) and (0.4, 0.6), respectively. For the CP dynamics, the parameters are Θ=0.35, *Δ*=0.45 and *λ*~*i*~ and *δ*~*i*~ are randomly distributed in the ranges (0.7, 0.9) and (0.2, 0.4), respectively. The network size *N* is 200 with average node degree ‹*k*›=4. The results are obtained by ensemble averaging over ten independent realizations. The success rate is determined by setting a cut-off according to [Supplementary Fig. 1a](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and the method described in [Supplementary Note 4](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}.\n\nNote that a network is reconstructed through the union of all neighbourhoods, which may encounter 'conflicts' with respect to the presence/absence of a link between two nodes as generated by reconstruction centred at the two nodes. The conflicts would reduce the accuracy in the reconstruction of the entire network. To characterize the effects of edge conflicts, we study the consistency of mutual assessment of the presence or absence of link between each pair of nodes, as shown in [Fig. 2b,c](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}. We see that inconsistency arises for small values of but vanishes completely when the success rates reach 100%, indicating complete consistency among the mutual inferences of nodes and consequently guaranteeing accurate reconstruction of the entire network. Detailed results of success rates and trade-off measures with respect to a variety of model and real networks are displayed in [Table 1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}, [Supplementary Figs 2 and 3](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}. and [Supplementary Note 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}.Table 1Performances of reconstruction and locating hidden source.**Network reconstructionError of** ***λ*LHSSRELSRNCTPRFPRMeanMinMaxTPRFPR***SIS* WS1.01.01.00.00.0080.00.0421.00.001 ER0.9920.9910.9920.0090.0140.00.1920.9770.026 BA0.9770.9860.9770.0140.0460.01.8810.990.066 prison0.9940.9930.9940.0070.0320.00.3111.00.017 Santafe0.9780.9910.9780.0090.0630.01.1221.00.041 netscience0.9590.9920.9590.0080.1720.02.8780.9490.144 NW1.00.9991.00.0010.0150.00.151.00.001 ZK0.9810.9930.9810.0070.0790.0010.7120.970.078 Polbooks0.9320.9840.9320.0160.1330.01.18750.7320.234 Football0.9700.9890.9700.0110.1660.0010.6510.6120.021 Dolphin0.9520.9670.9520.0330.0220.0010.1230.9250.083 Leadership0.9750.9860.9750.0140.050.00.7060.8690.057*CP* WS1.01.01.00.00.0090.00.0480.9360.068 ER0.9991.01.00.00.010.00.0730.9250.327 BA0.9971.01.00.00.0080.00.0430.9430.08 Prison0.9950.9960.9960.0040.0050.00.0180.9110.012 Santafe0.9840.9960.9960.0040.0060.00.0360.9290.034 Netscience0.9960.9990.9960.0010.0070.00.1661.00.050 NW1.01.01.00.00.0090.00.0520.980.034 ZK0.9920.9920.9920.0080.0070.0010.0220.9770.028 Polbooks0.9730.9950.9730.0050.0080.00.0420.8290.386 Football0.9950.9970.9950.0030.0060.00.0280.5170.015 Dolphin0.9520.9710.9710.0290.0060.00.0260.7860.059 Leadership0.9960.9930.9930.0070.0060.00.0130.8570.075FPR, false positive rate; LHS, locating hidden source; SREL, success rates for existent link; SRNC, success rates for null connection; TPR, true positive rate.The accuracy of network reconstruction is quantified by the success rates SREL and SRNC, as well as the trade-off measures TPR and FPR.

We study how the length of time series affects the accuracy of reconstruction. [Figure 3a,b](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the success rate as a function of the relative length *n*~*t*~ of time series for SIS and CP dynamics on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, where *n*~*t*~ is the total length of time series from the beginning of the spreading process divided by the network size *N*. The results demonstrate that even for very small values of *n*~*t*~, most links can already be identified, as reflected by the high values of the success rate shown. [Figure 3c,d](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the minimum length required to achieve at least 95% success rate for different network sizes. For both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks, decreases considerably as *N* is increased. This seemingly counterintuitive result is due to the fact that different base strings can share strings at different times to enable reconstruction. In general, as *N* is increased, will increase accordingly. However, a particular string can belong to different base strings with respect to the threshold Δ, accounting for the slight increase in the absolute length of the time series (see [Supplementary Fig. 4](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}) and the reduction in (see [Supplementary Note 3](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} on the method to choose base and subordinate strings). The dependence of the success rate on the average node degree ‹*k*› for SIS and CP on different networks has been investigated as well (see [Supplementary Fig. 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}). The results in [Figs 2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [3](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [Supplementary Figs 2--5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Table 1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"} demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of our reconstruction method based on small amounts of data.Figure 3Effect of the length of time series and network size.(**a**,**b**) Success rate as a function of the relative length *n*~*t*~ of time series for SIS (**a**) and CP (**b**) in combination with Newman--Watts (NW) and Barabási--Albert (BA) networks.

(**c**,**d**) the minimum relative length that assures at least 95% success rate as a function of the network size *N* for SIS (**c**) and CP (**d**) dynamics on NW and BA networks. Here the success rate is the geometric average over SREL and SRNC. For SIS dynamics, *λ*ε(0.1, 0.3) and *δ*ε(0.2, 0.4). For CP dynamics, *λ*ε(0.7, 0.9) and *δ*ε(0.3, 0.5). In **a** and **b**, the network size *N* is 500. The other parameters are the same as in [Fig. 2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Note that *n*~*t*~≡*t/N*, where *t* is the absolute length of time series, and , where *t*~min~ is the minimum absolute length of time series required for at least 95% success rate.\n\nIn practice, noise is present and it is also common for time series from certain nodes to be missing, and it is necessary to test the applicability of our method in more realistic situations. [Figure 4a,b](#Fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the dependence of the success rate on the fraction *n*~f~ of states in the time series that flip due to noise for SIS and CP dynamics on two types of networks. We observe that the success rates are hardly affected, providing strong evidence for the applicability of our reconstruction method. For example, even when 25% of the nodal states flip, we can still achieve about 80% success rates for both dynamical processes and different network topologies. [Figure 4c,d](#Fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} present the success rate versus the fraction *n*~m~ of unobservable nodes, the states of which are externally inaccessible. We find that the high success rate remains mostly unchanged as *n*~m~ is increased from 0 to 25%, a somewhat counterintuitive but striking result. The high degree of robustness against the limit to accessing nodal states is elaborated further in [Supplementary Fig. 6](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}. We find that, in general, missing information can affect the reconstruction of the neighbouring vector, as reflected by the reduction of the gap between the reconstructed values associated with actual links and null connections. However, even for high values of *n*~m~, for example, *n*~m~=0.3, there is still a clear gap, indicating that a full recovery of all links is achievable. We have also found that our method is robust against inaccurately specified diffusion processes with fluctuation in infection rates (see [Supplementary Fig. 7](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 5](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}). Taken together, the high accuracy, efficiency and robustness against noise, missing information and inaccurately modelling of real dynamical processes provide strong credence for the validity and power of our framework for binary time-series-based network reconstruction.Figure 4Reconstruction against noise and inaccessible nodes.(**a**,**b**) Success rate as a function of the fraction *n*~f~ of the flipped states induced by noise in time series for SIS (**a**) and CP (**b**) dynamics on Erdös--Rényi (ER) and Barabási--Albert (BA) networks.

The network size *N* is 500 and ‹*k*›=4. The other parameters are the same as in [Fig. 2](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}.\n\nHaving reconstructed the network structure, we can estimate the infection and recovery rates of individuals to uncover their diversity in immunity. This is an essential step to implement target vaccination strategy in a population or on a computer network to effectively suppress/prevent the spreading of virus at low cost, as a large body of literature indicates that knowledge about the network structure and individual characteristics is sufficient for controlling the spreading dynamics^[@CR47],[@CR48],[@CR49],[@CR50]^. Here we offer an effective method to infer the individuals' infection rates *λ*~i~ based solely on the binary time series of the nodal states after an outbreak of contamination. (To our knowledge, there was no prior work addressing this critical issue.) In particular, after all links have been successfully predicted, *λ*~*i*~ can be deduced from the infection probabilities that can be approximated by the corresponding infection frequencies (see Methods). These probabilities depend on both *λ*~*i*~ and the number of infected neighbours. The reproduced infection rates *λ*~*i*~ of individuals for both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks are in quite good agreement with the true values with small prediction errors (see [Supplementary Fig. 8](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 6](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}). Results from a comprehensive error analysis are listed in [Table 1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}, where the uniformly high accuracy validates our method. The inhomogeneous recovery rates *δ*~*i*~ of nodes can be predicted from the binary time series in a more straightforward way, because *δ*~*i*~ do not depend on the nodal connections (see [Supplementary Fig. 9](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 6](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}). Thus, our framework is capable of predicting characteristics of nodal diversity in terms of degrees, and infection and recovery rates based solely on binary time series of nodal states.\n\nLocating the hidden source of propagation {#Sec6}\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWe assume that a hidden source exists outside the network but there are connections between it and some nodes in the network. In practice, the source can be modelled as a special node that is always infected. Starting from the neighbourhood of the source, the infection originates from the source and spreads all over the network. We collect a set of time series of the nodal states, except the hidden source (see Methods). The basic idea of ascertaining and locating the hidden source is based on missing information from the hidden source when attempting to reconstruct the network. In particular, to reconstruct the connections belonging to the immediate neighbourhood of the source accurately, time series from the source are needed to generate the matrix **Φ** and the vector **Y**. However, as the source is hidden, no time series from it are available, leading to reconstruction inaccuracy and, consequently, anomalies in the predicted link patterns of the neighbouring nodes. It is then possible to detect the neighbourhood of the hidden source by identifying any abnormal connection patterns^[@CR51]^, which can be accomplished by using different data segments. If the inferred links of a node are stable with respect to different data segments, the node can be deemed to have no connection with the hidden source; otherwise, if the result of inferring a node's links varies significantly with respect to different data segments, the node is likely to be connected to the hidden source. The s.d. of the predicted results with respect to different data segments can be used as a quantitative criterion for the anomaly. Once the neighbouring set of the source is determined, the source is then precisely located topologically.\n\n[Figure 5](#Fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} presents an example, where a hidden source is connected with four nodes in the network ([Fig. 5a](#Fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"}), as reflected in the network adjacency matrix ([Fig. 5b](#Fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We implement our reconstruction framework on each accessible node by using different sets of data in the time series. For each data set, we predict the neighbours of all nodes and generate an adjacency matrix. Averaging over the elements corresponding to each location in all the reconstructed adjacency matrices, we obtain [Fig. 5c](#Fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"}, in which each row corresponds to the mean number of links in a node's neighbourhood. The inferred links of the immediate neighbours of the hidden source exhibit anomalies. To quantify the anomalies, we calculate the structural s.d. *σ* from different data segments, where *σ* associated with node *i* is defined through the *i*th row in the adjacency matrix asFigure 5Locating an external hidden source from time series.(**a**) Hidden source treated as a special node (in red) is connected to four nodes in the network (blue). The time series of other nodes except the source (number 50) after the outbreak of an epidemic are assumed to be available. (**b**) True adjacency matrix of the NW network with identical link weights to facilitate a comparison with the reconstructed adjacency matrix. (**c**) Reconstructed adjacency matrix from a number of segments in time series. The four neighbouring nodes of the source are predicted to be densely linked to other nodes, as indicated by the average value of the elements in the four rows corresponding to these nodes. (**d**) Structural variance *σ* of each node. The four neighbouring nodes of the source exhibit much larger values of *σ* than those from the other nodes, providing unequivocal evidence that they belong to the immediate neighbourhood of the hidden source.\n\nwhere *j* denotes the column, represents the element value in the adjacency matrix inferred from the *k*th group of the data, is the mean value of *a*~*ij*~ and *g* is the number of data segments. Applying equation (10) to the reconstructed adjacency matrices gives the results in [Fig. 5d](#Fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"}, where the values of *σ* associated with the immediate neighbouring nodes of the hidden source are much larger than those from others (which are essentially zero). A cut-off value can be set in the distribution of *σ*~*i*~ to identify the immediate neighbours of the hidden source (see [Supplementary Fig. 1b](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 4](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}). The performance of locating hidden source by means of the trade-off measures (true positive rate versus false positive rate) are displayed in [Table 1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\nDiscussion {#Sec7}\n==========\n\nWe have developed a general framework to reconstruct complex propagation networks on which epidemic spreading takes place from binary time series. Our paradigm is based on compressed sensing, is completely data-driven and practically significant for controlling epidemic spreading through targeted vaccination. Both theoretically and practically, our framework can be used to address the extremely challenging problem of reconstructing the intrinsic interacting patterns of complex stochastic systems based on small amounts of polarized time series. The key to success of our method lies in our development of a novel class of transformation, allowing the network inference problem to be converted to the problem of sparse signal reconstruction, which can then be solved by the standard compressed-sensing algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of our framework in uncovering the network structure, the natural diversity in the nodal characteristics, and any hidden source are guaranteed by the CST with rigorous proof for low-data requirement and convergence to optimal solution. The feasibility of our framework has been demonstrated using a large number of combinations of epidemic processes and network structures, where in all cases highly accurate reconstruction is achieved. Our approach opens up a new avenue towards fully addressing the inverse problem in complex stochastic systems in a highly efficient manner, a fundamental stepping stone towards understanding and controlling complex dynamical systems in general.\n\nWe have focused on two types of spreading dynamics, SIS and CP, where an infected individual can recover and becomes susceptible again. In this regard, even if an outbreak occurs, control strategy such as targeted vaccination or quarantine can be helpful to eliminate the virus eventually. A main purpose of our work is to identify the key individuals in the network to implement target control and to locate the source of infection to isolate it so as to prevent recurrent infection in the future. Although for any spreading dynamics, the most effective way to prevent a large-scale outbreak is to implement control during the early stage, this may be impractical in many situations. If we miss the early stage, which is possible especially in complex networks where the epidemic threshold can be near zero, to be able to reconstruct the spreading network is of tremendous value. Besides disease spreading, our framework is applicable to rumour or information spreading. In this case, identifying the source of rumour is important, a problem that our framework is capable of solving.\n\nOur work raises a number of questions to further and perfect the theoretical and algorithmic development of reconstructing complex dynamical systems. For example, if partial knowledge about the network structure is available, the information can be incorporated into our framework to further reduce the required data amount. Moreover, for non-Markovian spreading processes, our current reconstruction framework may fail. This raises the need to develop new and more general approaches. Nevertheless, our theory, due to its generality and applicability to various types of inhomogeneous interactions, can be applied to networks of networks or interdependent networks, in which there may be different spreading patterns associated with distinct layers or components. Taken together, our results provide strong credence to the proposition that complex networks can be fully decrypted from measurements, even when stochastic disturbance and hidden sources are present. This can offer a deeper understanding of complex systems in general and significantly enhance our ability to control them based on, for example, the recently developed controllability theory of complex networks^[@CR52],[@CR53],[@CR54],[@CR55],[@CR56],[@CR57],[@CR58]^.\n\nMethods {#Sec8}\n=======\n\nSpreading processes {#Sec9}\n-------------------\n\nThe SIS model is a classic epidemic model that has been used frequently to study a variety of spreading behaviours in social and computer networks. Each node of the network represents an individual and links are connections along which infection can propagate to others with certain probability. At each time step, a susceptible node *i* in state 0 is infected with rate *λ*~i~ if it is connected to an infected node in state 1. If *i* connects to more than one infected neighbour, the infection probability *P*^01^ is given by equation (4). At the same time, infected nodes are continuously recovered to be susceptible at the rates *δ*~i~. The CP model has been used extensively to describe, for example, the spreading of infection and competition of animals over a territory, where *λ*~*i*~ is determined by equation (7). The main difference between SIS and CP dynamics lies in the influence on a node's state from its vicinity. In both SIS and CP dynamics, *λ*~*i*~ and *δ*~*i*~ depend on the individuals' immune systems and are selected from a uniform distribution characterizing the natural diversity (see [Supplementary Note 7](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} for details of numerical simulations). Moreover, a hidden source is regarded as infected for all time.\n\nMathematical formulation of reconstruction based on CST {#Sec10}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor SIS dynamics, suppose measurements at a sequence of times *t*=*t*~1~, *t*~2~, ···, *t*~*m*~ are available. equation (5) leads to the following matrix form **Y**~*m*\\ ×\\ 1~=**Φ**~*m*\\ ×\\ (*N*−1)~·**X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~:\n\nwhere the vector **X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~ contains all possible connections between node *i* and all other nodes, and it is sparse for a general complex network. We see that if the vector **Y**~*m*\\ ×\\ 1~ and the matrix **Φ**~*m*\\ ×\\ (*N*−1)~ can be constructed from time series, **X**~(*N*−1)\\ ×\\ 1~ can then be solved by using CST. The main challenge here is that the infection probabilities at different times are not given directly by the time series of the nodal states. To devise a heuristic method to estimate the probabilities, we assume that the neighbouring set Γ~*i*~ of the node *i* is known. The number of such neighbouring nodes is given by *k*~*i*~, the degree of node *i* and their states at time *t* can be denoted as\n\nTo approximate the infection probability, we use *S*~*i*~(*t*)=0 so that at *t*+1, the node *i* can be infected with certain probability. In contrast, if *S*~*i*~(*t*)=1, *S*~*i*~(*t*+1) is only related with the recovery probability δ~*i*~. Hence, we focus on the *S*~*i*~(*t*)=0 case to derive . If we can find two time instants: *t*~1~, *t*~2~ε*T* (*T* is the length of time series), such that *S*~*i*~(*t*~1~)=0 and *S*~*i*~(*t*~2~)=0, we can then calculate the normalized Hamming distance between and , where the normalized Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is defined as ratio of the number of positions with different symbols between them and the length of string. If , we can regard the states at the next time step, *S*~*i*~(*t*~1~+1) and *S*~*i*~(*t*~2~+1), as i.i.d Bernoulli trials. In this case, using the law of large numbers, we have\n\nA more intuitive understanding of (equation (12)) is that if the states of *i*'s neighbours are unchanged, the fraction of times of *i* being infected by its neighbours over the entire time period will approach the actual infection probability . Note, however, that the neighbouring set of *i* is unknown and to be inferred. A strategy is then to artificially enlarge the neighbouring set to include all nodes in the network, except *i*. In particular, we denote\n\nIf *H*\\[*S*~−*i*~(*t*~1~), *S*~−*i*~(*t*~2~)\\]=0, the condition will be ensured. Consequently, due to the nature of i.i.d Bernoulli trials, from the law of large numbers, we have\n\nHence, the infection probability of a node at can be evaluated by averaging over its states associated with zero-normalized Hamming distance between the strings of other nodes at some time associated with . In practice, to find two strings with absolute zero-normalized Hamming distance is unlikely. We thus set a threshold Δ so as to pick the suitable strings to approximate the law of large numbers, that is\n\nwhere serves as a base for comparison with *S*~−*i*~(*t*) at all other times and . As is not exactly zero, there is a small difference between and . We thus consider the average of for all *t*~*ν*~ to obtain , leading to the right-hand side of equation (14). We denote and . To reduce the error in the estimation, we implement the average on *S*~−*i*~(*t*) over all selected strings through equation (14). The averaging process is with respect to the nodal states *S*~*j*,\\ *j*,≠*i*~(*t*) on the right-hand side of the modified dynamical equation (5). Specifically, averaging over time *t* restricted by equation (14) on both sides of equation (5), we obtain . If *λ*~i~ is small with insignificant fluctuations, we can approximately have (see [Supplementary Fig. 10](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 8](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"}), which leads to . Substituting by , we finally get\n\nAlthough the above procedure yields an equation that bridges the links of an arbitrary node *i* with the observable states of the nodes, a single equation does not contain sufficient structural information about the network. Our second step is then to derive a sufficient number of linearly independent equations required by CST to reconstruct the local connection structure. To achieve this, we choose a series of base strings at a number of time instants from a set denoted by *T*~base~, in which each pair of strings satisfy\n\nwhere and correspond to the time instants of two base strings in the time series and Θ is a threshold. For each string, we repeat the process of establishing the relationship between the nodal states and connections, leading to a set of equations at different values of in equation (15), as described in the matrix form (equation (6)). See [Supplementary Fig. 11, 12](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Supplementary Note 8](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} for the dependence of success rate on threshold Δ and Θ for SIS and CP dynamics in combination with four types of networks.\n\nInferring inhomogeneous infection rates {#Sec11}\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe values of the infection rate *λ*~i~ of nodes can be inferred after the neighbourhood of each node has been successfully reconstructed. The idea roots in the fact that the infection probability of a node approximated by the frequency of being infected calculated from time series is determined both by its infection rate and by the number of infected nodes in its neighbourhood. To provide an intuitive picture, we consider the following simple scenario in which the number of infected neighbours of node *i* does not change with time. In this case, the probability of *i* being infected at each time step is fixed. We can thus count the frequency of the 01 and 00 pairs embedded in the time series of *i*. The ratio of the number of 01 pairs over the total number of 01 and 00 pairs gives approximately the infection probability. The infection rate can then be calculated by using equations (4) and (7) for the SIS and CP dynamics, respectively. In a real-world situation, however, the number of infected neighbours varies with time. The time-varying factor can be taken into account by sorting out the time instants corresponding to different numbers of the infected neighbours, and the infection probability can be obtained at the corresponding time instants, leading to a set of values for the infection rate whose average represents an accurate estimate of the true infection rate for each node.\n\nTo be concrete, considering all the time instants *t*~*ν*~ associated with *k*~I~ infected neighbors, we denote , ∀ *t*~*ν*~, and *S*~*i*~(*t*~ν~)=0, where Γ~*i*~ is the neighbouring set of node *i*, *k*~I~ is the number of infected neighbours and represents the average infected fraction of node *i* with *k*~I~ infected neighbours. Given , we can rewrite equation (4) by substituting for and for λ~*i*~, which yields . To reduce the estimation error, we average with respect to different values of *k*~I~, as follows:\n\nwhere Λ~*i*~ denotes the set of all possible infected neighbours during the epidemic process and denotes the number of different values of *k*~I~ in the set. Analogously, for CP, we can evaluate from equation (7) by\n\nwhere is the node degree of *i*. Insofar as all the links of *i* have been successfully reconstructed, can be obtained from the time series in terms of the satisfied *S*~*i*~(*t*~*ν*~+1), allowing us to infer via equations (17) and (18).\n\nNote that the method is applicable to any type of networks insofar as the network structure has been successfully reconstructed.\n\nNetworks analysed {#Sec12}\n-----------------\n\nModel networks and real networks we used are described in [Supplementary Note 10](#MOESM1226){ref-type=\"media\"} and [Table 1](#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\nAdditional information {#Sec13}\n======================\n\n**How to cite this article:** Shen, Z. *et al*.

{"text": "Obshchina\n\nObshchina (, literally \"commune\") or mir (, literally \"society\", among other meanings), or selskoye obshchestvo (, \"rural community\", official term in the 19th and 20th century; ), were peasant village communities as opposed to individual farmsteads, or khutors, in Imperial Russia. The term derives from the word obshchiy (, literally \"common\").\n\nThe vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a mir community which acted as a village government and a cooperative. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household. The purpose of this allocation was not so much social (to each according to his needs) as it was practical (that each person pay his taxes). Strips were periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census to ensure equitable share of the land. This was enforced by the state which had an interest in the ability of households to pay their taxes.\n\nHistory \nThe concept of Obshchina was an important part in Old Russia and hat its roots from Slavic communities. A detailed statistical description of the Russian village commune was provided by Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov. Communal land ownership of the mir predated serfdom, surviving emancipation and the Russian Revolution). Until the abolition of serfdom in 1861, the mir could either contain serfs or free peasants. In the first case, lands reserved for serf use were assigned to the mir for allocation by the proprietor.\n\nEven after the 1861 emancipation of the serfs, a peasant in his everyday work normally had little independence from obshchina, governed at the village level (mir) by the full assembly of the community (skhod). Among its duties were control and redistribution of the common land and forest (if such existed), levying recruits for military service and imposing punishments for minor crimes. Obshchina was also held responsible for taxes underpaid by members. This type of shared responsibility was known as krugovaya poruka (mutual responsibility), although the exact meaning of this expression has changed over time and now in Russian it has a negative meaning of mutual cover-up.\n\nIn 1905, repartitional tenure did not exist in the Baltic provinces, but it was used by a quarter of western and southwestern (i.e. Ukrainian) peasants, two thirds of steppe peasants and 96.9% elsewhere.\n\nThe institution was effectively destroyed by the Stolypin agrarian reforms (1906–1914), the implementation of which would lead to the Russian Revolution and subsequent collectivization in the Soviet Union.\n\nStructure \n\nThe organization of the peasant mode of production is the primary cause for the type of social structure found in the obshchina. The relationship between the individual peasant, the family and the community leads to a specific social structure categorized by the creation of familial alliances to apportion risks between members of the community. In the obshchina, alliances were formed primarily through marriage and common descent of kin. Usually, the eldest members of the household made up the mir to govern the redistribution of land. The families came together to form a community that depended on making taxes more equitable and the concept of mutual help. Jovan E. Howe writes: \"The economic relations so established are essentially distributive: through various categories of exchanges of both products and labor, temporary imbalances such as those occasioned by insufficient labor power of a newly-established family unit or a catastrophic loss, which places one unit at an unfair reproductive disadvantage in relation to its allies, are evened out\". In addition, the alliance system had residual communal rights, sharing exchanges during shortages as well as certain distributive exchanges. Furthermore, the structure defined by these alliances and risk-sharing measures were regulated by scheduling and the ritualization of time. Howe writes that \"the traditional calendar of the Russian peasants was a guide for day-to-day living. The names attached to calendar dates, the calendrical periods into which they were grouped, the day on the week on which each fell, and the sayings connected with them encoded information about when to undertake tasks, but also about when not to work, when it was necessary to perform symbolic actions, take part in rituals and compulsory celebrations\".\n\nPeasants (i.e. three-quarters of the population of Russia) formed a class apart, largely excepted from the incidence of the ordinary law and governed in accordance with their local customs. The mir itself, with its customs, is of immemorial antiquity, but it was not until the 1861 emancipation of the serfs that the village community was withdrawn from the patrimonial jurisdiction of the landowning nobility and endowed with self-government. The assembly of the mir consists of all the peasant householders of the village. These elect a Village Elder (starosta) and a collector of taxes who was responsible, at least until the ukaz of October 1906 which abolished communal responsibility for the payment of taxes, for the repartition among individuals of the taxes imposed on the commune. A number of mirs are united into a volost which has an assembly consisting of elected delegates from the mirs.\n\nThe mir was protected from insolvency by the rule that the families cannot be deprived of their houses or implements necessary for agriculture; nor can the mir be deprived of its land.\n\nView on obshchinas \nThe mir or obshchina became a topic in political philosophy with the publication of August von Haxthausen's book in 1847. It was in the mid-19th century that Slavophiles discovered the mir. Romantic nationalists and the Slavophiles hailed the mir as a purely Russian collective, both ancient and venerable; free from what they considered the stain of the bourgeois mindset found in western Europe. Not surprisingly, it was but a short step from this to the mir being used as a basis for Slavophilic idealist theories concerning communism, communalism, communal lands, history, progress and the nature of mankind itself.\n\nBy the second half of the 19th century, the Slavophiles were challenged by the opposing Western faction. Boris Chicherin, a leading spokesman for the Western school, argued that the mir was neither ancient nor particular to Russia. The mir, the Western school argued, had arisen in the late 17th to early 18th century and was not based on some sort of social contract or communal instinct. Rather, it was a monarchical creation, created and enforced for the purpose of tax collection. Whatever the merits of either case, both schools agreed that the landlord and the state both played a vital role in the development (if not the origin of) the mir:\n\nWhere (arable) land is scarce, the communal form of tenure tends to prevail, but where ever it (arable land) is abundant it is replaced by household or even family tenue.\n\nThe 19th-century Russian philosophers attached signal importance to obshchina as a unique feature distinguishing Russia from other countries. Alexander Herzen, for example, hailed this pre-capitalist institution as a germ of the future socialist society. His Slavophile opponent Aleksey Khomyakov regarded obshchina as symbolic of the spiritual unity and internal co-operation of Russian society and worked out a sophisticated \"Philosophy of Obshchina\" which he called sobornost.\n\nThe European socialist movement looked to this arrangement as evidence that Russian peasants had a history of socialization of property and lacked bourgeois impulses toward ownership:\n\nRussia is the sole European country where the \"agricultural commune\" has kept going on a nationwide scale up to the present day. It is not the prey of a foreign conqueror, as the East Indies, and neither does it lead a life cut off from the modern world. On the one hand, the common ownership of land allows it to transform individualist farming in parcels directly and gradually into collective farming, and the Russian peasants are already practising it in the undivided grasslands; the physical lie of the land invites mechanical cultivation on a large scale; the peasant’s familiarity with the contract of artel facilitates the transition from parcel labour to cooperative labour; and, finally, Russian society, which has so long lived at his expense, owes him the necessary advances for such a transition. On the other hand, the contemporaneity of western production, which dominates the world market, allows Russia to incorporate in the commune all the positive acquisitions devised by the capitalist system without passing through its Caudine Forks [i.e. undergo humiliation in defeat].\n\nSee also \n\n Commons\n Kolkhoz\n Opština\n Repartition (periodic strip redistribution)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Richard Pipes's Russia Under the Old Regime\n\nExternal links \n Mir - infoplease\n \n\nCategory:Agricultural labor\nCategory:Economic history of Russia\nCategory:Agricultural economics\nCategory:Local government in the Russian Empire\nCategory:Society of the Russian Empire\nCategory:Russian words and phrases", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Provided by our guest authorHonestly Banking, the undercover banker.\n\nAt\nHonestly Banking we wanted to have a look inside the workings of Swaps,\nHedging, Caps and Collars and throw some light into this obscure and\ncomplicated world. There has been a remarkable amount of media interest around the Swap mis-selling scandal. Inevitably it is hard to capture the real\ncomplexities of this involved area without over simplifying matters or getting\nhighly technical.\n\nA brief background: Banks have been selling Interest Rate\nDerivatives under the guise of ‘risk management’ for many years, firstly to big\ncorporates, then to smaller companies and then when the greed got the better of\nthem to anyone they could. You may think this sounds a lot like the sub-prime\nmortgages. Back then banks sold mortgages to unsuitable clients. Now they are\nselling swaps to unsuitable clients. Different product, same motivation – a\nquick profit.\n\nWith lower Interest Rates many people are discovering\nthat they have been sold something that actually increases their risk.\nAdditionally the banks have not been sticking to the rules and have been\nprofiteering at the expense of small businesses and individuals. This is a\ncompletely different order of magnitude to PPI mis-selling. Homes, businesses,\nfarms and livelihoods are being lost. Families are being ripped apart. Barclays have tried to gag their clients from even talking to the regulator, the FSA, about it.\n\nBanks have developed this area into a highly profitable\nmulti-million pound industry. It’s so profitable they have set up many regional\nsales centres to peddle their wares. They are staffed typically by smooth\ntalking ‘risk advisors’ who bamboozle the unsuspecting client into something\nthat will possibly be the worst decision of their lives.\n\nInterest Rate Hedges (we will call them Hedges for\nbrevity) fall into two main sorts. Those made of barriers and Swaps. They are\nall constructed out of Derivatives called Interest Rate Options. We will\nconcentrate on the barrier type in this article as Swaps are really a series of\nbarriers.\n\nThe\nsimplest and most effective ‘Hedge’ is the Interest Rate Cap. Here the client never pays more than the Cap\nlevel that they can choose to match their needs best. They get the full benefit\nfrom any falls in Interest Rates and there’s no break (penalty for ending the\ncontract) cost as the premium is paid straight away up front. It’s a bit like having a cap on your mortgage interest rate.\nRemember, no SME buys a hedge to make a profit – they just want to get protection\nfrom surprise interest rate hikes. It’s also the one banks sell the least of\nand are mostly likely not to mention to you. The simple reason is they make the\nsmallest profit on them.\n\nA development of the Cap is the Collar where the bank\nmakes the client agree to a floor (below which the interest rate won’t fall\nwhatever happens to the base rate), ostensibly to reduce the premium. In\nreality the value of the Floor far outweighs the cost of the Cap and the bank\nslyly pockets the difference. This also introduces new risks to the business of\nfalling Interest Rates and means that the client is now speculating on Interest\nRates - they are becoming Derivative Traders. If the interest rate falls\nbeneath the floor then the client doesn’t benefit from the lower rate.\n\nIn the\nexample below, which is similar to Mr Adcocks’ toxic hedge, the floor is 4.7%.\nHowever much the Interest Rate falls beneath Floor Barrier, the client pays the\nbank the difference between the Interest Rate and the Floor, plus an equal\namount above the Floor. This means as Interest Rates go down, the rate the\nClient pays actually increases. This isn’t risk management – it’s gambling.\nThat’s what banks do, not SMEs.\n\nAs we\ncan see in the example below, when Interest Rates drop to 2% the client is\npaying 2.7% below the floor and 2.7% above the floor giving the client an\nInterest Rate of 7.4%!\n\nThe effect on Mr Adcock is that he has had to lose 2\nmembers of staff and this toxic structure has cost him over £175,000, in\naddition to the original £970,000 loan. Of course Barclays have made a fat\nprofit out of Mr Adcock’s misfortune.\n\nAs can be seen in this example, a Structured Collar is a\nvery poor Hedge against Interest Rate movements as there is only a narrow\nbenefit within the collar; thereafter it increases the risk to the client.\nThere are many other toxic Hedges being sold, often including the bank (only)\nhaving the option to cancel or extend the structure. These are Hedges, they are\nroulette.\n\nThe banks are not explaining all the risks and clients\nare pressurised into agreeing to these Hedges without fully understanding them.\nThe banks know that they are required by legislation not to trade these\nproducts if the client doesn’t understand them – this is breached on a daily\nbasis.\n\nThere is another hidden feature of Interest Rate Hedges\nthat the banks have liked to keep quiet, and that is the cost of getting out of\nthem. These are known as the exit or break costs. Banks like to use jargon to\nconfuse their customers so they call this ‘mark to market’. Banks typically\ntell clients that there may be a cost or indeed a benefit when you exit your\nHedge, but normally don’t give you any idea of how big this can be.\n\nThe break costs depends on market conditions and is a\nreal cost to the bank as it goes and incurs this cost in the Interest Rate\nmarket. On a typical fixed rate loan this is a pre-agreed amount, often a\npercentage of the loan from 1-5%. On a Hedge it will fluctuate, but currently\nexit costs are varying from 25%-50% of the loan. This is because the Hedges are\nmade up of Derivatives that derive their value from an underlying market. A\nsmall movement in this market can be magnified many times over, creating a huge\nliability. The way many of these trades are structured means that low interest\nrates have caused these high exit costs which the clients are stuck with if they\nwant to exit. This is in addition to the loan repayment, the interest, and the\nfees. If you are confused by this, then you are in good company: not only the\nripped-off SME businesses, but also many bankers. This is precisely why complex\nproducts like this are not permitted to be sold to unsophisticated customers.\nWhat this means is a business that borrows £1,000,000 may have to find another\n£500,000 to get out of the Hedge. As many clients are now saying, ‘if they told\nme that up-front I never would have agreed to it’.\n\nInside the bank’s Swap Sweat Shops there are legions of sales people, all getting\nbonuses, and they all have targets. It’s in their interests to sell the clients the\nmost complex and costly Hedge possible. One rule is clear from the world of\nHedging, that we would advise clients to keep in mind next time the sales man\ncomes to call. The more complex the name of the Hedge, the more profitable it\nis for the bank and the worse it is for the client.\n\nDespite the esoteric nature of the Hedging world, there’s\nbeen a notable up swell of activity by those affected. Probably the best known\nis Bully-Banks, which orchestrated a meeting of MPs on the\nissue. The FSA are slowly looking at the area and there have been some court\ncases settled already. The other concerning development is the plethora of\nclaims management firms advertising in this area. This is a far more complex area\nthan PPI and most of these claims companies do not have the relevant experience or\nrequired regulatory licences to advise on these Hedges. We may be selling\nanother scandal developing in the claims management world.\n\nWarren Buffet famously described Derivatives as being ‘weapons of financial mass destruction’\nin 2003, some 5 years before the current financial crisis started. He also\nwarned that Derivatives can push companies into a \"spiral that can\nlead to a corporate meltdown\". This is now happening across the nation\nof shopkeepers that is Britain. Why did the banks push people into unsuitable\nand dangerous contracts that will destroy their lives? It wasn’t banks\nproviding prudent risk management, it was avarice.\n\n[Authors Note: Interest Rate\nHedges, Swaps, Caps, Collars and Derivatives are a very complex area. This\narticle inevitability over-simplifies some of the issues. For more in-depth\ndiscussion, please visit www.HonestlyBanking.co.uk]\n\n[Note from Jake: in June 2012 the FSA completed its investigation and instructed the banks to compensate their \"unsophisticated\" customers, stating the \"sophisticated\" customers are not covered. The FSA, in the judgement, defined \"sophisticated\" as being a customer who met \"at least two of the following: (i) a turnover of\nmore than £6.5 million; or (ii) a balance sheet total of more than £3.26\nmillion; or (iii) more than 50 employees.\" This is the EU definition of a 'small business', letting the banks off compensating any medium sized businesses. So the battle is still on.]\n\nBarclays never even offered me the option of a Cap, Just 4 different SWAPS, I understand why now!!!! They never told me it would cost 25% of the initial amount to get out either. I hope we all issue a class action against the banks because it's obvious we will win this one. It's modern day highway robbery.\n\nIf your bank didn't offer you a Cap - there are serious questions by them to be answered by them. They must act in the client's best interest. When dealing with the banks make sure you keep detailed notes and copies of all correspondence - we hear that many are finding this level of detail useful when it comes to challenging the banks.\n\nIf you've been ripped off by a cap and collar load or ISRA, tread warily towards litigation. There are many poachers-turned-gamekeepers - former IRSA salesmen - out there offering their 'advice' via claims management companies. These same people may become involved in cases as witnesses for the banks, creating a clear conflict of interest if you hire them for your matter. One other problem: how can they act as your adviser AND fulfil their primary duty of expert witness without the bank applying to exclude their evidence for bias?\n\nInstead, why not use a barrister or solicitor to advise? An opinion from a barrister under the new direct 'Public Access Scheme' won't cost a fortune and may help secure 'After The Event' funding for your litigation, whether you subsequently use counsel direct or a solicitor.\n\nYou need to put a clear case together showing the bank - and not variable trading conditions - are primarily responsible for any losses and those losses all stem from a mis-sold IRSA. Additionally, these cases will usually require independent expert evidence that there were alternative and more suitable products on the market when the mis-selling occured.\n\nBe careful to assemble your case BEFORE negotiating with the bank. These are complex matters which are best tackled with an experienced lawyer on board. You may need representation to convince a court to grant an injunction to restrain the bank from closing your account if you are going to approach them for transcripts of the sales call and copies of correspondence. Otherwise the the bank may simply spot oncoming litigation and 'pull the plug' if you are in a weak financial position.\n\nDebate on misselling of interest rate swaps to small businesses held in Parliament on 21/6. Watch the video, and read the transcript. More information here, as MPs are covered by Parliamentary Privilege and can say what they want:\n\nWe are a SME with at the time of entering into the swap over 120 employees and a multi million pound turnover.\n\nWe switched banks after long negotiations with Barclays and on the face of it looked to be gaining better pricing and additional facilities...at the very last stage, they slipped in the condition of the swap agreement, sold as so called protection (whose protection?) against rising interest rates.\n\nFour years on we are still struggling day to day with the servicing of the swap and wish we’d never switched to Barclays. We were never warned about, the probable impact on the business and breakage costs should we repay the loan early or what the impact would be should interest rates fall as they have done. It was just all glossed over by a sharp selling so called ‘advisor’.This needs to be urgently looked at by Parliament as businesses like ours are being squeezed to such a point that they simply can’t cope, all down to the greed of the banks who put these products in place. In our case, I’m not sure if or how long we will survive as we’re on borrowed time. But some food for thought for the government who are concerned about employment figures and ‘helping businesses’ in this economic climate; if we are just one of the 100,000 or so businesses that have been sold a swap by Barclays and our story is typical of their swap customers, all employees in our company possibly or probably will lose their jobs in the very near future. It’s hard to believe this can really happen after more than 25 years in business.Personally I think the banks should be brought to account and be made to fully refund all customers who were sold these products and should be forced to pay compensation for damages. After the PPI scandal which has affected countless individuals the government should be now focusing on these swap products which will also affect tens of thousands of employees through bank forced business failures.\n\nThe mis-selling of interest rate swap products by the UK banks has caused significant losses to many businesses and it is possible to claim compensation.Visit us for get all information about interest rate swap mis sellingIRSA Mis Selling\n\nTruly excellent piece. There is little wonder I continue to battle with HBOS's penchant for falsehoods if this kind of trickery has been their bread and butter. I wrote this in disgust. http://lifeafterdebts.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/close-encounters-of-third-kind.html\n\nWhilst I know about the underlying instruments, I was unaware how these structured rate products are being sold to people who don't need them. It's usually enough trouble to decide whether to borrow fixed or floating. I am especially concerned how sales staff are being incentivised to sell these products. This comes up time and time again. No doubt it was 'that nice man who has always helped us with our finances'.\n\nMore regulation is one solution. More education is another.

\"that's a miracle.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who is your mother, anyway?\" \" She's...\" \" Never mind who she is!\" \"She's supposed to be my grandmother, I suppose?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I guess he is.\" \"You know I don't care who she is!\" \"I don't care who you are.\" \"This is so fucked up!\" \"Fucking asshole.\" \" I just thought... maybe...\" \" What!\" \"Just thought what?\" \"Just thought you'd casually drive back into town here?\" \"Back to the scene of the crime twenty some years later... and just kind a introduce yourself?\" \"Thought maybe we'd slap each other on the back, go have a couple shots of Tequila and crack a few jokes about \"the old lady\"\" \"or something stupid like that!\" \"Is that it?\" \"Huh?\" \"Is that what you thought?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You're not my father!\" \"You've never have been my father and you never will be!\" \"You got that?\" \"Go fuck yourself, man.\" \"You're pathetic!\" \"Huh, oh fuck.\" \"He didn't jump, did he?\" \"What?\" \"No.\" \"Good.\" \"That's good.\" \"He wouldn't talk to you, I guess?\" \"No.\" \"No?\" \"He wouldn't talk to me either.\" \"He's scared, I guess.\" \"Why would he be scared 'a you?\" \"Just the idea that we might be related.\" \"He doesn't wanna be related, I don't think.\" \"Guess not.\" \"Do you?\" \"What?\" \"Wanna be related?\" \"I thought I did.\" \"Why?\" \"Why suddenly, when you haven't been for so long?\" \"I just started thinking maybe I missed everything.\" \"You know, maybe I threw everything away.\" \"Cut myself off.\" \"Why did you let so much time go by?\" \"I didn't know it was passing.\" \"You're gonna leave now?\" \"Leave town?\" \"I mean, since it didn't work out with Earl?\" \"I've got nowhere to go.\" \"Maybe you should just stay here.\" \"You mean live here?\" \"In Butte?\" \"Yeah why not?\" \"It's not a bad little town.\" \"Lots of history.\" \"What am I gonna do here?\" \"Make it your home.\" \"You need a home, don't you?\" \"I'll be back in a while.\" \"Okay?\" \"Where're you going?\" \"Don't go away!\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Where're you going?\" \" Jake?\" \" Hey!\" \"I've got somethin' for you.\" \"Here you are, Doreen.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Have a good one.\"

remember you in yellow.\" \"You always looked good in yellow.\" \"I never wore yellow.\" \"It must'a been someone else.\" \"What're you doing up so early?\" \"I never went to bed.\" \"Must have a lot on your mind, huh?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You look awful.\" \"I suppose.\" \"So, how are you two getting along?\" \"Any progress?\" \"Who?\" \"Oh, you mean...\" \"Your son, Howard.\" \"How are you getting along with your son.\" \"It's hopeless, I think.\" \"Oh.\" \"You haven't given it much of a shot, have you?\" \"In a couple days and you just...\" \"what?\" \"Give up?\" \" I haven't given up.\" \" No?\" \" No.\" \"I justrealized...\" \" What?\" \"That... it's you...\" \"It's youl came up here for.\" \"It's you I wanted to see.\" \"What's so funny?\" \"Oh God.\" \"You're unbelievable, Howard.\" \"What do you mean?\" \" Ooh!\" \"How many years has it been?\" \" What's that got to do with it?\" \"Everything!\" \"It's got everything to do with it.\" \"When time goes by people.\" \"you know people slip away from each other if they don't have contact.\" \"Yeah, but I mean, we could.\" \"Maybe get back together again!\" \"What are you out of your mind!\" \"No.\" \"I mean there's no reason we couldn't have some kind of a...\" \" You know er...\" \" What?\" \"Reconciliation or something.\" \" Reconciliation?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Reconciliation!\" \"Now we've got lawyer talk!\" \"No.\" \"I mean you know, you know we should've gotten married.\" \"We should have.\" \"Don't you think?\" \" Married?\" \" Yeah.\" \" Married?\" \" Yeah.\" \"I realize that now.\" \"That was my big mistake.\" \"We should have got married and settled down right here...\" \" I did settle down right here, Howard.\" \" Yeah.\" \"I know, but\" \"Oh, stop it!\" \"Just stop it!\" \"You're an absolute idiot, Howard!\" \"You come back here supposedly wanting to meet up with your abandoned son.\" \"I don't know why exactly.\" \"Maybe guilt.\" \"Was that it?\" \"Huh... to relieve yourself of some kind of guilt?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I don't care.\" \"But you know it might have made... some little difference... in Earl's life.\" \"And that would've been great.\" \"But now that probably won't even happen because you're just too gutless to see this thing through.\" \"You're a coward Howard.\" \"That rhymes, doesn't it?\" \"But you are, you're a total coward.\" \"And now... now you wanna hide and run away again, don't you?\" \"You wanna hide and disappear into my life.\" \"You want me to give you cover, don't you, Howard?\" \"No...\" \"Don't lie to me!\" \"Lie to yourself!\" \"You just keep telling yourself that there is some remote possibility that some pathetic woman somewhere on this planet... is gonna take pity on you and save you from the truth.\" \"But it's not me.\" \"I am not that woman and I never will be.\" \"What if he actually was your father?\" \"What's so out rage us about that?\" \"He just came to see you?\" \"Like a friendly visit.\" \"I don't need a father!\" \"It's too late for a father!\" \"You don't know that.\" \"Might be really nice to have a father.\" \" You don't know.\" \" Nice?\" \"Yeah.\" \"He could be a really nice guy.\" \"He's not a nice guy!\" \"He's a fucking jerk.\" \"Do you know?\" \"You just have that in your head, Earlie.\" \"Shut up, would you!\" \"What do you know what's in my head?\" \"You know you can't just go around judging people like that all the time.\" \" Yes, I can!\" \" No, you can't.\" \"You judge meall the time and I'm not so bad.\" \"You're terrible.\" \"You're like that stupid cricket from Pinocchio.\" \" What's Pinocchio?\" \" Oh, shut up.\" \"You know, you really made a mess here, Earl.\" \"Yeah, he pissed me off.\" \"You musta' gone ballistic.\" \"You threw all this out that window?\" \"What're you looking for anyway?\" \"Aah!\" \"Found it!\" \"How much power does that thing have?\" \"Enough.\" \"You know...\" \"you should really see what he wants.\" \"I mean, talk to him at least.\" \"That can't hurt.\" \"See if he wants to give you a gazillion dollars or something.\" \"You ever thought about that?\" \"Nope.\" \" I have a question for you.\" \" Yes?\" \"How do you distinguish between the 'Hash Browns', the 'Home Fries' and the 'Red Buds'?\" \"I'm not familiar...\" \"Oh, well, there's three different kinds of potatoes that you can have with your eggs.\" \"No, that's not my question.\" \"What I'm trying to find out is the difference between the three.\" \"Oh!\" \"Sure.\" \"I...\" \"I'm sorry, you know.\" \"I was thinking about something else.\" \"The 'Home Fries' well, they are pretty much just your regular ordinary old 'Home Fries', the 'Hash Browns', those are shredded and then fried in butter and the 'Red Buds' we leave the skins on them.\" \"You just serve them with the skins left on?\" \" Is that right?\" \" Yes, that's right.\" \"I...\" \"I mean, they're boiled and everything.\" \" They're boiled?\" \" Yes, and... and then the uh,\" \"Then the skin kind of peels off them.\" \" It peels?\" \" Well, um, blisters kind of.\" \"Can I have a glass of water, please.\" \"And thank you for your time.\" \"Well, you're welcome.\" \"Where's Howard?\" \" Who?\" \" Howard.\" \"He was just sitting here on this sofa.\" \"Howard.\" \"You know who I'm talking about.\" \"Where's Howard?\" \"Where's Howard?\" \"Earl!\" \"Earlie!\" \"There's somebody here.\" \"Wants to know where is Howard.\" \"Who's Howard?\" \"Where is Howard?\" \"Who is Howard?\" \"We wanna know.\" \"We wanna know.\" \"Where is Howard?\" \"Who is Howard?\" \"Where did he go?\" \"Where did he go?\" \"He's down in the ditches.\" \"He's down in the ground.\" \"Disappeared himself.\" \"He's nowhere to be found.\" \"Where is Howard?\" \"Who is Howard?\" \"He's long gone.\" \"He's long gone.\" \" Hey, you got fifty bucks?\" \" What?\" \"No.\" \"Yeah, you gotta have fifty bucks.\" \"No.\" \"No.\" \"Look, look.\" \"I'm...\" \"I'm just...\" \"I...\" \"I'm just heading out of town here.\" \"I... need to get out of town.\" \"Had enough of beautiful uptown Butte?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You gotta leave a little money behind.\" \"Bolster the economy.\" \" Now, look...\" \" You gotta' have fifty bucks.\" \"Ah, all I got is a dollar.\" \"How about a dollar?\" \"That be all right?\" \"A dollar?\" \"Here is a dollar.\" \" A dollar!\" \" Yes.\" \"What?\" \"Do I look like a welfare bum?\" \"Do I

{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\nRadical-based dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has continued to attract considerable attention in recent years due to its intriguing nature to form stable molecular self-assemblies *via* a clean radical--radical coupling process.[@cit1]--[@cit3] In particular, the stimuli-responsive nature of radicals to form σ-bonds in a reversible manner has been used as an attractive tool for various applications.[@cit2] In recent studies, a number of dicyanomethyl-substituted aromatic compounds were reported to show such reversible self-dimerization-dissociation processes.[@cit3] Among them, the study by Seki and co-workers demonstrated that *p*-diphenylamino-substituted dicyanomethyl radical **1** underwent clean DCC to form its σ-dimer (**1**)~2~ in a reversible manner.[@cit3a] In addition to this, they have also reported reversible formation of the π-dimer of the more stable aryl-dicyanomethyl radical **2** possessing a fused nitrogen atom ([Chart 1](#cht1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).[@cit3d] Recently, Chi and co-workers have reported three-dimensional DCC of aryl-dicyanomethyl radicals, which resulted in the construction of a large cyclic hexamer, whose structure was elucidated by single-crystal X-ray analysis.[@cit3e] Further, Winter and co-workers described the effect of the structure--activity relationship on aryl-dicyanomethyl radicals.[@cit3g]\n\n![(a--c) Reported dicyanomethyl based radicals.

Ar = 4-methylphenyl, Ar^1^ = 3,5-di-*tert*-butylphenyl and Ar^2^ = mesityl.](c9sc01631g-c1){#cht1}\n\nFollowing these results, we have reported that (*meso*-subporphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radical **3** is quite stable and does not undergo any dimerization.[@cit4] As an extension, we examined the chemistry of (porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals, since porphyrins have been demonstrated to be a nice platform to stabilize neighboring radicals owing to effective spin-delocalization.[@cit5],[@cit6] While various types of porphyrin-based stable radicals have been explored, those undergoing reversible σ-dimerization are still quite rare,[@cit7] except the important examples.[@cit8] In the present work, (*meso*- and β-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals were examined and displayed contrasting behaviors in solutions. (Porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals constitute a rare example displaying stable radical *versus* dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) depending upon the substitution position of the dicyanomethyl radical. In particular, (*meso*-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals do not form any σ- or π-dimers and exist predominantly as a monomer radical in solution, while (β-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals show DCC by forming σ-dimers in a reversible manner. These results contrast sharply with the previous reports that oxidation of 5,10- and 5,15-dicyanomethyl-substituted porphyrins gave closed shell quinonoid compounds.[@cit9]\n\nResults and discussion\n======================\n\n(*meso*-Porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn the synthesis of *meso*-dicyanomethylporphyrins, we employed a simple nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S~N~Ar) of *meso*-halogenated porphyrins[@cit4]**4--7** with malononitrile in the presence of NaH in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) at 60 °C, which produced the desired products **8--11** in 65--70% yields as stable compounds ([Scheme 1](#sch1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Notably, these S~N~Ar reactions proceeded nicely even for sterically hindered substrates **5**, **6** and **7**. The ^1^H NMR spectrum of **8** shows a singlet at 7.01 ppm due to the dicyanomethyl group (Fig. S17[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}), while peaks of **9--11** are observed in the range of 7.35--8.00 ppm (Fig. S19, S21 and S23[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). These trends are comparable with the previously reported subporphyrin results,[@cit4] and have been ascribed to effective hydrogen bonding interaction between the methine proton in the dicyanomethyl group and the β-halogens. The structure of **9** was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis ([Fig. 1a](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), which revealed the distance between the methine hydrogen and β-chlorine atom to be 2.468(1) Å, suggesting intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction. The *meso*-dicyanomethyl group is largely tilted by 52.17(9)° from the mean plane of the Ni([ii]{.smallcaps}) porphyrin.\n\n![Synthesis of **8--15**. (i) 10 equiv. malononitrile, 10 equiv.

The *meso*-aryl groups in (b and d) and hydrogen atoms in (a--d) are omitted for clarity.](c9sc01631g-f1){#fig1}\n\nOxidation of *meso*-dicyanomethyl porphyrins **8--11** with an excess amount of PbO~2~ in CH~2~Cl~2~ gave the corresponding dicyanomethyl radicals **12--15** in 63--70% yields ([Scheme 1](#sch1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). All these radicals were stable and tolerant towards moisture and air and separable by silica-gel column chromatography. These radicals were NMR silent even at low temperatures and EPR active (Fig. S45[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). The structure of radical **12** was revealed by single crystal X-ray analysis ([Fig. 2](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In the unit cell, three radicals of slightly different structures formed an offset stacking aggregate with interporphyrin separations of *ca.* 3.5 and 3.7 Å. Therefore, the structure of **12** was studied based on averaged values. The dicyanomethyl radical group was tilted towards the porphyrin plane with a small dihedral angle of 38.08° and a C--C bond distance of 1.395 Å, which is shorter as compared to the regular C--C single bond (1.45 Å), indicating a double bond character and effective spin delocalization over the porphyrin ring. These structural features are comparable with those of the previously reported subporphyrins and other dicyanomethyl derivatives.[@cit3d],[@cit3g],[@cit4]\n\n![Single crystal X-ray structure of **12**. (a) Top view and (b) close interaction between radical pairs. The *meso*-aryl groups in (b) and the peripheral hydrogen atoms in (a and b) have been omitted for clarity.](c9sc01631g-f2){#fig2}\n\nThe absorption spectra of **8--11** in CH~2~Cl~2~ showed Soret-like bands around 420 nm and Q-like bands between 550 and 600 nm as typical absorption features of porphyrin (Fig. S47--S50[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). The absorption spectra of radicals **12--15** in CH~2~Cl~2~ showed red shifted Soret-like bands at around 470 nm and Q-like bands between 600 and 900 nm along with a radical-characteristic broad absorption band extending to 1600 nm (Fig. S47--S50[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). Importantly, there were no significant changes of the absorption spectra of **12--15** upon temperature change in line with the discussion above (Fig. S51--S55[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}).\n\nFurther, the magnetic properties of radicals **12--15** in the solid state were examined by SQUID magnetometry (Fig. S46[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). The observed *χT*--*T* curves clearly indicated intermolecular weak anti-ferromagnetic interactions, which were reproduced with a modified Bleaney--Bowers model. The best simulation plots of **12--15** were obtained with parameters of (*f*~1~, *f*~2~, *J*~1~/*k*~B~) = (0.713, 0.105, --4.85 K), (0.225, 0.313, --33.7 K), (0.170, 0.374, --29.1 K) and (0.141, 0.397, --24.7 K), respectively.[@cit10] Collectively, the dicyanomethyl radicals **12--15** are concluded to exist as a monomeric stable species in solution and in the solid-state.\n\n(β-Porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals\n-------------------------------------\n\nOur initial attempt to produce simple β-dicyanomethyl-substituted porphyrin **20** by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of β-bromoporphyrin **16** did not proceed well, while the same reaction proceeded nicely for β,β-dihalogenated porphyrins **17--19** with malononitrile in the presence of NaH in DMI at 100 °C to afford **21--23** in moderate yields ([Scheme 2](#sch2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The simple β-dicyanomethyl porphyrin **20** was prepared in 74% yield by a Pd-catalyzed coupling reaction of **16** with malononitrile in the presence of NaH in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) at 80 °C ([Scheme 2](#sch2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The structure of **21** was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis ([Fig. 1c](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), which revealed the bond length between the dicyanomethyl unit and porphyrin to be 1.597(5) Å and the tilt angle of the dicyanomethyl unit from the mean plane of the porphyrin to be 49.83(2)°.\n\n![Synthesis of **20--27**.

These dimers were separated by silica gel column chromatography in 50--71% yields. The molecular ion peaks of (**24**)~2~--(**27**)~2~ were not detected but the half values were observed at *m*/*z* = 993.5096, 1073.4174, 1119.4040 and 979.2468 (M^+^), respectively, matching with the expected radical compositions (Fig. S13--S16[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}).\n\nDimers (**24**)~2~--(**27**)~2~ showed common temperature-dependent ^1^H NMR spectral features. As a typical example, the ^1^H NMR spectra of (**27**)~2~ at various temperatures are shown in [Fig. 3a](#fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}. The spectrum was rather broad at 298 K but became increasingly sharper upon decreasing the temperature, which, judging from the previous related studies,[@cit3] has been interpreted in terms of DCC between the monomeric radical **27** and its σ-dimer (**27**)~2~. At high temperatures a certain amount of monomeric radical exists but the σ-dimer dominates at 193 K. We succeeded in the X-ray structural determination of (**27**)~2~. [Fig. 3b and c](#fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the structure of (**27**)~2~ which is a covalently linked *syn*-dimer, in which the formed C--C bond length is very long, 1.635(1) Å, which is marginally longer than that of the reported examples undergoing DCC.[@cit3a],[@cit3e]\n\n![(a) ^1^H-NMR spectrum of (**27**)~2~ in CD~2~Cl~2~ at various temperatures; (b and c) X-ray crystal structure of (**27**)~2~. *meso*-Aryl groups in (c) and hydrogen atoms in (b and c) have been omitted for clarity.](c9sc01631g-f3){#fig3}\n\nIn line with DCC, (**24**)~2~--(**27**)~2~ showed reversible temperature dependent absorption spectra. As the representative example, the variable temperature absorption spectra of (**27**)~2~ in toluene are shown in [Fig. 4](#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Upon increasing the temperature, the typical absorption bands of normal porphyrins, *i.e.* the Soret band at 414 nm and Q-bands at 535 and 571 nm, decreased and broad bands around 490 and 672 nm as well as a very broad tail in the NIR range of 1000--1400 nm emerged. These spectral changes have been interpreted to indicate that (**27**)~2~ exists predominantly at room temperature and undergoes homolysis to give persistent dicyanomethyl radical **27** at high temperatures. This interpretation was strongly reinforced by variable temperature EPR measurement, which actually showed increased EPR signal intensity at higher temperatures ([Fig. 4](#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}, inset). Similar variable temperature absorption spectra and EPR spectra were observed for (**24**)~2~ (Fig. S60[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}), (**25**)~2~ (Fig. S61[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}) and (**26**)~2~ (Fig. S62[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). On the basis of these experiments, the thermodynamic parameters of DCC were determined ([Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Overall, the VT-NMR, VT-UV, and VT-EPR studies clearly supported the conclusion that the products exist in an equilibrium state between the σ-dimers and radicals.\n\n![Absorption spectra of (**27**)~2~ in toluene at various temperatures.

The stable neutral radicals **12--15** exhibit two reversible oxidation waves and two reversible reduction waves. The energy gap between the first oxidation and reduction potentials of compounds **12--15** was very small, characteristic of radical species.

For *meso*-dicyanomethyl radicals **12--15**, the spin density maps clearly show that the spin is fully delocalized over the whole π-network of porphyrin backbones (Fig. S73[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}). On the other hand, the spin density in β-dicyanomethyl radicals **24--27** is less delocalized and large spin densities are found at the dicyanomethyl unit and neighbouring β-carbon. Spin densities at the dicyanomethyl center clearly indicate a difference depending on the substitution position: 0.19--0.29 for **12--15** and 0.47--0.49 for **24--27**. For **12--15**, the spin density at the dicyanomethyl center largely depends on the neighboring β-substituent(s): 0.289 (**12**) \\> 0.242 (**14**) ∼ 0.234 (**15**) \\> 0.191 (**13**). This trend is related to the average tilt angles of the dicyanomethyl group toward the porphyrin plane; **12** (32.3°) \\< **14** (39.1°) ∼ **15** (39.7°) \\< **13** (44.7°) (Fig. S85[†](#fn1){ref-type=\"fn\"}).

(*meso*-Porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals are very stable, exist as monomeric species and do not undergo any recombination in solution or in the solid state. On the other hand, (β-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals are isolated as covalent σ-dimers, which are stable in the solid state but display DCC behavior in solution; namely, they undergo homolysis to form a persistent dicyanomethyl radical at high temperatures. This marked difference can be ascribed to better spin delocalization in (*meso*-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals as compared with (β-porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals. Further studies on (porphyrinyl)dicyanomethyl radicals are actively ongoing in our laboratories.\n\nConflicts of interest\n=====================\n\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\nSupplementary Material\n======================\n\nSupplementary information\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nCrystal structure data\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 25220802, 18H03910, and 18K19074.

{"text": "Mixed muscle protein synthesis and breakdown after resistance exercise in humans.\nMixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and fractional breakdown rate (FBR) were examined after an isolated bout of either concentric or eccentric resistance exercise. Subjects were eight untrained volunteers (4 males, 4 females). Mixed muscle protein FSR and FBR were determined using primed constant infusions of [2H5]phenylalanine and 15N-phenylalanine, respectively. Subjects were studied in the fasted state on four occasions: at rest and 3, 24, and 48 h after a resistance exercise bout. Exercise was eight sets of eight concentric or eccentric repetitions at 80% of each subject's concentric 1 repetition maximum. There was no significant difference between contraction types for either FSR, FBR, or net balance (FSR minus FBR). Exercise resulted in significant increases above rest in muscle FSR at all times: 3 h = 112%, 24 h = 65%, 48 h = 34% (P < 0.01). Muscle FBR was also increased by exercise at 3 h (31%; P < 0.05) and 24 h (18%; P < 0.05) postexercise but returned to resting levels by 48 h. Muscle net balance was significantly increased after exercise at all time points [(in %/h) rest = -0.0573 +/- 0.003 (SE), 3 h = -0.0298 +/- 0.003, 24 h = -0.0413 +/- 0.004, and 48 h = -0.0440 +/- 0.005], and was significantly different from zero at all time points (P < 0.05). There was also a significant correlation between FSR and FBR (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). We conclude that exercise resulted in an increase in muscle net protein balance that persisted for up to 48 h after the exercise bout and was unrelated to the type of muscle contraction performed.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "This proposal aims to understand the changes in visual processing that occur when subjects shift between alert and non-alert waking states. While great advances have been made in understanding central mechanisms of visual perception of alert, attentive subjects, there is little understanding of cortical processes that come into play when alertness wanes. The awake, non-alert state is not equivalent to anesthesia, or to sleep states. When non-alert, we are capable of perception, but our perceptual capacities differ. It is commonly believed that accidents happen when we are not alert, but the extent to which early thalamic or visual cortical mechanisms may be responsible for this (as opposed to higher cognitive processes) is an open question. This proposal relies on a unique model system that is very well-suited to address this question: the awake rabbit, an animal who's inner mental life transparently and frequently shifts between alert and nonalert EEG-defined states, and who's stable eyes and diffident nature make it an ideal subject for these experiments. The proposed research will examine how changes in the brain state of awake subjects influence the multiple, sequential stages of information processing that occur within the visual thalamocortical, intracortical, and cortical output networks. The experiments will compare state dependent changes in the visual response properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons at the input layer and within several output systems of the cortex and will investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to these changes, at the subthreshold and spiking level. This work will lead to a better understanding of cortical mechanisms of visual processing in a dynamic, awake brain. From a health perspective, these studies will have an important impact on our understanding of how alertness/vigilance deficits can impact visual perception and performance, and will provide the basis for future clinical studies of human mental health and behavioral disorders.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

The tetrahedron subsequently became the central product of Tetra Pak, which was founded in 1951 as a subsidiary to Åkerlund & Rausing.\n\nRausing joined Tetra Pak as deputy managing director in 1954. Over the years the company evolved from a small family business with six full-time employees, in 1954, into a multi-national corporation with over 20,000 employees (2011), a development much of which has been credited to the leadership of Rausing and his brother throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The great success of the business was largely the result of their development of aseptic packaging technology, developed in the 1950s and early 1960s and later called the most important food packaging innovation of the 20th century.\n\nRausing had a parallel career as a scholar in pre-historic Scandinavian archaeology and was a Reader at the Institute of Archaeology at Lund University. Asked how he could uphold a position in senior management of a global corporation and do archaeological research at the same time, he stated \"a fair number of left-over hours in airports and planes\" as his key to finding the time.\n\nPatronage\nRausing's passion for the humanities led to his frequent sponsoring of various research projects, among others the excavation of the 10th Century Viking trading town of Birka outside Stockholm.

Given the important roles clusters of galaxies play in the studies of both astrophysics and cosmology, tremendous efforts have been made during the past several decades to search for these systems. The first large samples of clusters were identified by looking for projected galaxy overdensities through visual inspection of photographic plates [@Abe58; @Abe89; @Zwi68]. These catalogs made pioneering contributions to our understanding of the extragalactic universe and since their generation have opened many new frontiers in the studies of galaxy clusters. However, the compilation of a relatively complete and pure sample of galaxy clusters has remained far from trivial. To date the Abell catalog, which contains about 4000 rich clusters to a redshift of $z\\sim0.2$, is still the most widely used cluster catalog in the field, though it was realized early that visually-constructed catalogs suffer from projection effects, subjectivity, and large uncertainties in estimated properties [@Sut88]. It is difficult to apply these catalogs for statistical studies in cosmology because of these uncertainties, in addition to the fact that the selection function and false positive rates of such cluster samples are hard to quantify.\n\nTo relieve some of these concerns, other approaches for identifying clusters have also been designed and implemented, such as reconstructing the full 3-D structures in complete redshift surveys [@Huc82; @Gel83; @Ram97], detecting clusters in X-ray surveys [@Gio90; @Edg90; @Ebe98; @Ros98; @Rom00; @Sch00; @Boh01; @Mul03; @Boh04], and utilizing the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect [@Car00; @Moh02; @Pierpa05] and weak gravitational lensing [@Sch96; @Wit01] in search for clusters. Moreover, the realization of large and deep galaxy surveys in recent years has revived optical cluster-finding endeavors and prompted the development of more automated and rigorous algorithms to select clusters from imaging surveys. Using multi-color photometric data from which photometric redshifts can be estimated, it is now possible to mitigate the problems of projection effects, and quantitative analysis of the selection bias is also now possible. Automated peak-finding techniques in optical cluster searches were attempted by @She85 and later used in the Edinburgh/Durham survey [ED @Lum92] as well as the Automatic Plate Measurement Facility survey [APM @Dal94; @Dal97]. In the construction of the cluster catalog from the Palomar Distant Cluster Survey [@Pos96], a matched filter algorithm was developed to select clusters from a photometric galaxy sample. It was widely used in subsequent surveys and several variants have been put forward [@Kaw98; @Sch98; @Kep99; @Kim02; @Whi02]. Meanwhile with the knowledge of the existence of the “E/S0 ridgeline” of cluster galaxies in color-magnitude space and the aid of multi-color CCD photometry, several color-based cluster-finding techniques were also investigated [@Gla00; @Got02; @Gla05; @Mil05]. Some of these have already been successfully applied to select clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data [@Got02; @Ann02; @Bah03; @Mil05; @Koe07].\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey [@Yor00] is a five-band CCD imaging survey of about 10$^4$ deg$^{2}$ in the high latitude North Galactic Cap and a smaller deeper region in the South, followed by an extensive multi-fiber spectroscopic survey. The imaging survey is carried out in drift-scan mode in five SDSS filters ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$) to a limiting magnitude of $r\\sim22.5$ [@Fuk96; @Gun98; @Lup01; @Smi02]. The spectroscopic survey targets $\\sim$10$^{6}$ galaxies to $r\\sim17.7$, with a median redshift of $z\\sim0.1$ [@Str02], and a smaller deeper sample of $\\sim$10$^{5}$ Luminous Red Galaxies out to $z\\sim0.5$ [@Eis01]. In this paper we discuss a modified adaptive matched filter technique incorporating several new features over previous algorithms and designed to detect clusters using both the SDSS imaging and spectroscopic data; it could readily be adapted to other similar multi-band, large-area galaxy surveys for construction of optically-selected cluster samples. It is the first of a series of papers that will explore the application of the technique to select clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nThe general idea of the matched filter method relies on the fact that clusters show on average a typical density profile, now widely assumed to be the “NFW” form suggested first by Navarro, Frenk and White [@Nav96]. Assuming that galaxies trace the dark matter, we expect galaxies within clusters to be distributed according to such profile. The algorithm selects regions in the sky where the distribution of galaxies corresponds to the projection of average cluster density profile. In addition, it is possible to specify the galaxy redshift information inside clusters, and to use prior knowledge on the galaxy luminosity function. The combination of these matched subfilters thus enables us to extract a quantitative signal corresponding to the existence of a cluster at a given location in the surveyed sky area.\n\nThe modified matched filter technique presented in this paper can fully adapt to imaging surveys with spectroscopic measurements, multicolor photometric redshifts, no redshift information at all, and any combination of these within one survey. In the Sloan Digital Sky Survey where photometric redshifts can be estimated with well-understood error distributions from the five-band ($u$,$g$,$r$,$i$,$z$) multi-color photometry, the matched filter technique described here utilizes not only the spectroscopic coverage for the bright main sample galaxies and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) but also the photometric redshift information for most of the galaxies detected in the imaging survey. This greatly expands the input galaxy sample to feed into the cluster-finding algorithm compared to pure spectroscopic methods [e.g. @Mil05]. The obtained composite cluster catalog can also go much deeper in redshift ($z\\sim0.4-0.5$ in this case) than the typical $z\\sim0.2$ limit for spectroscopic samples due to the lack of availability of spectroscopic measurements for faint, deep galaxies.\n\nSince the matched filter technique does not explicitly use the information about the red sequence to select clusters as is done in some color-based cluster-finding methods [@Ann02; @Mil05; @Koe07], it can theoretically detect clusters of any type in color, and is not restricted only to old, red E/S0 galaxies. Such clusters likely dominate the cluster population, but may not constitute all of it especially as one probes systems of lower richness and at higher redshifts. The use of both spectroscopic and photometric redshift information largely eliminates the projection effects and removes most of the phantom clusters. The matched filter also generates accurate quantitative estimates of derived cluster properties, such as redshift, scale, richness, and concentration, and produces quantitative detection likelihoods, indicative of the combined information for both red and blue galaxies identified as cluster members. These facilitate further studies of detected systems and makes easier the comparison to clusters selected by other methods. One major concern for the matched filter technique is the fact that determination of these parameters depends on the specific cluster model we put in to build the relevant filters. However, these effects can be minimized by careful assumptions about the shape and evolution of luminosity function, and by the fact that our density filter is self-adaptive to different cluster scales and concentration. The clusters selected by the algorithm will provide us the necessary sample on which we then apply an iterative procedure aimed at refining the constraints on clusters’ properties. More details will be discussed in section §\\[sec:Algorithm\\] and subsequent work following this paper.\n\nThe new algorithm presented here differs from previous matched filter implementations [@Kep99; @Kim02] in several ways. We use a uniform Poisson likelihood analysis, which is only the second step in the approach by @Kep99 following a first pass using Gaussian statistics for pre-selection of clusters. This avoids the common problem for high-redshift clusters of having too few galaxies in any cell of interest for Gaussian statistics to apply, and the adopted approach yields correct likelihoods even at the detection stage. In addition, both the core radius and virial radius of the matched filter are adaptive over the typical observed dynamical range for clusters, in contrast to most previous cluster-finding techniques that set the cluster core radius or search radius to be fixed. For each individual cluster, a best-fit core radius is found to maximize the likelihood match, as well as an outer radius inside which the galaxy overdensity reaches $\\Delta$=200. The cluster richness is then normalized to be the light contained within this virial radius, which we find correlates better with the mass of gravitational systems whose extent is defined by density contrast as is widely adopted in theoretical studies. The new features of our modified algorithm will be further discussed in §\\[sec:Algorithm\\].\n\nIn order to understand the biases and the selection functions of our algorithm, we test it on a mock SDSS catalog which has been constructed from the Hubble Volume Simulation [@Evr02] by assigning luminosities and colors to the dark matter particles in a manner which reproduces many characteristics of the galaxy population from SDSS observations. The “observations” of the simulations have then been further modified so that the redshift scatter of those galaxies which have photometric but no spectroscopic redshifts correspond to that of the photometric redshift errors in actual SDSS data. The comparison of the detected cluster sample with halos in the simulation provides the only rigorous way to assess how the observed cluster properties relate to the real masses, and how the cluster sample can be used to derive cosmological constraints.\n\nIn section §\\[sec:Algorithm\\] we describe the modified adaptive matched filter technique and how it is used to extract the cluster sample. Section §\\[sec:Simulation\\] presents the basic features of the simulated catalog we adopted for the testing purpose. In section §\\[sec:Results\\] we show results on the completeness and purity of our cluster sample, and the expected scaling relations inferred from runs on the simulations. We conclude in section §\\[sec:Conclusion\\].\n\nA flat $\\Lambda$CDM model with $\\Omega_m=0.3$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$ is used throughout this work, and we assume a Hubble constant of $H_0=100 h$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ if not specified otherwise.\n\nThe Cluster-Finding Algorithm {#sec:Algorithm}\n=============================\n\nThe matched filter technique introduced here is a likelihood method which identifies clusters by convolving the optical galaxy survey with a set of filters based on a modeling of the cluster and field galaxy distributions. A cluster radial surface density profile, a galaxy luminosity function, and redshift information (when available) are used to construct filters in position, magnitude, and redshift space, from which a cluster likelihood map is generated. The peaks in the map thus correspond to candidate cluster centers where the matches between the survey data and the cluster filters are optimized. The algorithm automatically provides the probability for the detection, best-fit estimates of cluster properties including redshift, radius and richness, as well as membership assessment for each galaxy. The modified algorithm can be fully adaptive to current and future galaxy surveys in 2-D (imaging), 2$\\half$-D (where multi-color photometric redshifts and their errors can be estimated), and 3-D (with full spectroscopic redshift measurements). Usage of the apparent magnitudes and, where applicable, the redshift estimates instead of simply searching for projected galaxy overdensities effectively suppresses the foreground-background contamination, and the technique has proven to be an efficient way of selecting clusters of galaxies from large multi-band optical surveys.\n\nIn what follows, we first provide a general introduction on how the likelihood function is constructed and how we detect clusters with the matched filter method. This gives us an overview about how the cluster catalog is derived. Then we discuss in more detail the density models and subfilters used to construct the likelihood. More specifically, we assume an NFW density profile, a general Schechter luminosity function and a Gaussian model for BCGs to model clusters, and use the spectroscopic measurements and obtained error distributions of galaxy photometric redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to incorporate redshift uncertainties. In the end we describe how to determine the set of best-fit parameters on cluster properties that maximize the likelihood at a given position over a range of redshift, scale, concentration, and richness.\n\nLikelihood Function {#sec:Likelihood}\n-------------------\n\nThe likelihood function used here is based on the assumption that the probability of finding galaxies in an infinitesimal bin in angular position, apparent magnitude and redshift space is given by a Poisson distribution. Under this assumption, the total likelihood of many of such bins, which we take to be centered in the location of the galaxies in the survey, is (see appendix C2 in @Kep99 for a full derivation):\n\n$$ln {\\cal L} = -N_f -\\sum_{k=1}^{N_c}N_k +\\sum_{i=1}^{N_g}\\ln[P(i)],$$\n\nwhere $N_f$ is the total number of field galaxies expected within the searching area, $N_g$ is the total number of galaxies and $\\sum_{k=1}^{N_c}N_k$ is normalized to be the number of galaxies brighter than $L^*$ as members of the $N_c$ clusters assumed in the model. $P(i)$ represents the predicted probability density of galaxies in a given bin, which includes both probabilities of field galaxies ($P_f$) and of cluster members ($P_c$),\n\n$$P(i) = P_f(i) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N_c} P_{c}(i,k).$$\n\nThese probabilities are the expected number densities for a given location and magnitude.\n\nThe cluster catalog is constructed with an iterative procedure similar to the one used in @Koc03. We start our process from a density model of a smooth background with no clusters. For each galaxy position, we then evaluate the likelihood increment we would obtain by assuming that there is in fact a cluster centered on that galaxy. The likelihood is then optimized by varying the cluster galaxy number $N_k$, the redshift and cluster scale length. At each iteration, we retain the cluster candidate which resulted in the greatest likelihood increase. We incorporate it in our density model and restart the procedure. The function for finding the $k^{th}$ cluster in the whole surveyed area therefore is\n\n$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\Delta\\ln{\\cal L}(k) = -N_k + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_g}\\ln[{P_f(i)+\\sum_{j=1}^{k}P_c(i,j) \\over \n      P_f(i)+\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}P_c(i,j)}].\n\\end{array}$$\n\nA list of cluster candidates then becomes available in decreasing order of detection likelihoods. For each candidate one has derived properties, including best-fit position, scale, richness, and estimated redshift. The initial cluster catalog allows us to further inspect each individual candidate for exploration of substructure and better constraints on previously fitted quantities.\n\nDensity Model {#sec:Density}\n-------------\n\nAs both field and cluster galaxies are found in the survey, the probability of finding a galaxy in a given bin depends on the density of both these populations (see eq.(2)).\n\nFor galaxy $i$ with angular position $\\vec{\\theta}_i$, $r$-band apparent magnitude $m^r_i$ and redshift $z_i$ (when available), the background number density $P_f(i)$ can be directly extracted from the global number counts of the galaxy survey,\n\n$$P_f(i) = { d N \\over dm~ dz }(m^r_i, z_i),$$\n\nand it has to be modified to account for the effects of galaxy redshift uncertainties if photometric redshift estimates are used.\n\nFor cluster $k$ located at $\\vec{\\theta}_k$ with proper scale length $r_{ck}$, redshift $z_k$ and galaxy number $N_k$, the probability of galaxy $i$ being a member of it, $P_c(i,k)$, is just the product of a surface density profile $\\Sigma_c$ and a luminosity function $\\phi_c$ at the cluster’s redshift, times a distribution function $f(z_i- z_k)$ that expresses redshift uncertainties:\n\n$$P_c(i,k) = N_{k}\\ \\Sigma_c\\left[D_A(z_k)\\theta_{ik}\\right]\\ \\phi_c\\left[m^r_i-{\\cal D}(z_k);\n    \\right]\\ f(z_i-z_k),$$\n\nwhere ${\\cal D}(z_k)$ is defined through\n\n$$M^r_i = m^r_i - 5 \\log (D_L(z_k)/10\\mbox{pc}) - k(z_k) = m^r_i - {\\cal D}(z_k),$$\n\nand where $D_A(z_k)$ and $D_L(z_k)$ are the angular diameter and luminosity distance at the cluster’s redshift $z_k$, and $k(z_k)$ is the $k$-correction. The conversion of units in luminosity and distance is conducted by performing proper $k$-corrections for galaxies of different spectral types and choosing the proper cosmology (see §\\[sec:Introduction\\]).\n\nSubfilters {#sec:Subfilters}\n----------\n\nBased on current observational studies as well as findings from dark matter halos, and for convenient comparisons to theoretical models widely used in analytical studies and N-body simulations, we assume the density profile of galaxies within a cluster follows the form of a NFW profile [@Nav96], which in three dimensions is given by\n\n$$\\rho_c(r) = {1 \\over 4\\pi r_c^3 F(c)}{1 \\over {r \\over r_c}(1+{r \\over r_c})^2},$$\n\nwhere $c$ is the concentration parameter and $F(c)$ is the typical normalization factor for galaxies inside the virial radius of the cluster, $r_v=cr_c$. The 3-D profile is then integrated along the line of sight to derive a projected surface density profile $\\Sigma_c(r)$ which is expressible as a much more complicated analytical form (see @Bar96). The profile is normalized so that $\\int_0^{cr_c} 2\\pi r \\Sigma_c(r) dr = 1$.\n\nThe search radius for galaxies belonging to the cluster is set to be the virial radius of the cluster, or more specifically here, the radius inside which the mass overdensity is 200 times the critical density, i.e., 200$\\Omega_M^{-1}$ times the average background [@Evr02]. Since it is hard to directly measure the cluster mass overdensity in observations, we instead determine the virial radius inside which the space density of cluster galaxies is 200$\\Omega_M^{-1}$ times the mean field, assuming that the galaxy distribution in a halo traces the overall dark matter distribution (see discussions in @Han05), which has been suggested by recent observations and simulations [@Lin04a; @Nag05; @Lin07a], and is supported by weak lensing measurements [@She04]. For simplicity, we use $r_{200}$ throughout this work to denote the cluster virial radius determined by galaxy overdensities. The cluster richness is then defined to be the total luminosity in units of $L^*$ inside $r_{200}$.\n\nAs has been discussed before in matched-filter studies [@Pos96; @Kim02] and also shown by our own numerical experiments, the efficiency of the filter is usually much more sensitive to the overall filter cutoff radius than to the details of its shape. Therefore the determination of appropriate values for the scale length in the cluster model is of particular importance, as it may have significant impact on the detection efficiency of the cluster-finding algorithm. Most of the previous matched filter methods have used a carefully chosen fixed value for the model cluster cutoff radii, and they compute the galaxy number or the richness of clusters within such a fixed radius in physical units. @Pos96 concludes that a fixed search radius of 1 Mpc $h^{-1}$ is a near-optimal choice in their radial filter, and this value has been also adopted by @Kep99 [@Kim02] in their method which assumes a modified Plummer law model for the surface density profile. In @Whi02 and @Koc03, the authors set a fixed core radius of $r_c=200$ kpc $h^{-1}$ and concentration parameter of $c=4$ for the NFW profile in the cluster detection and mass estimates. Although we find from observations and simulations that these choices are reasonable values for typical rich clusters, a single fixed scale length for all clusters over a wide range of masses and concentrations will certainly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio, bias detection probabilities, and be responsible for at least part of the large scatter observed in previous cluster mass-richness scaling relations. In our modified adaptive matched filter algorithm, we optimize the core radius for each individual cluster over the dynamical range for typical galaxy clusters. For the core radius value that maximizes the likelihood, we then compute the normalized cluster richness according to the NFW profile with best-fit parameters within a cluster virial radius $r_{200}$ determined from galaxy overdensities. We believe this procedure is more similar to and comparable with the virial mass defined by density contrast in most theoretical studies and analyses of simulations.\n\nFor the magnitude filter, we adopt a luminosity profile described by a central galaxy plus a standard Schechter luminosity function [@Sch76]\n\n$$\\phi(M) = {dn \\over dM} = 0.4 \\ln10\\ n^* \\left({L \\over L^*} \\right)^{1+\\alpha} \\exp(-L/L^*);$$\n\nthe integrated luminosity function is\n\n$$\\Phi(M) = \\int_{-\\infty}^M \\phi(M) dM = n^* \\Gamma[1+\\alpha, L/L^*].$$\n\nParameters for the global luminosity function are obtained from the SDSS spectroscopic sample at the redshift of $z=0.1$ [@Bla03]. To account for the evolutionary effects at higher redshifts, we allow a passive evolution of $L^*$ which brightens about 0.8 magnitudes from $z=0$ to $z=0.5$ [@Lov92; @Lil95b; @Nag01; @Bla03; @Lov04; @Bal05; @Ilb05]. We assume that $L^*$ does not vary as a function of cluster richness, which is supported by the results of @Han05. Because the matched filter algorithm uses both a cluster galaxy luminosity function and a field galaxy luminosity function, which are expected to be different due to the morphology-density relation [@Dre80] and the observed dependence of luminosity function on galaxy over-densities [@Chr00; @Mo04; @Cro05], it would be desirable to model these separately. It would also be desirable to further model the luminosity distributions according to galaxy spectral types [@Fol99; @Lin99; @Hog03]. At this stage, however, only a single function is adopted since the work on precise luminosity functions for cluster galaxies of different types has just been started. We hope to investigate this further on the basis of the first catalog we produce. Once a cluster catalog is available for galaxies in all redshift ranges, we can go back and examine the impact of our assumptions about the galaxy luminosity functions as well as their evolution for different environments and spectral types. In order to use the same range in the luminosity function at all distances and therefore avoid bias associated with errors in the assumed form of the luminosity function, we cut off the luminosity function at one magnitude below $L^*$. We can still calculate total luminosities by integrating the assumed form, and we use this in our richness calculation, described below.\n\nThe existence of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) near the cluster centers is incorporated into our cluster galaxy luminosity model as a separate component from the main Schechter function for satellites, as this distinction has been clearly seen in clusters over a range of richness [@RT77; @Han05]. We assume a Gaussian distribution for the luminosities of these objects and adopt the results from @Lin04b for correlations between the BCG luminosity and host cluster properties. More specifically, the BCG luminosity is assumed to follow a single power law with the cluster richness, $L_{BCG} \\sim \\Lambda_{200}^{1\\over4}$, and we take the width of the Gaussian to be $\\sim0.5$ mag [@Lin04b; @Zhe05; @Han05]. The luminosity of BCGs is assumed to evolve in the same way as $L^*$ does, [*i.e. *]{} the luminosity at the mean of the gaussian has a constant ratio to $L^*$. This is almost certainly incorrect in detail, but will be explored in follow-up work once the catalog is constructed. This modification of the general Schechter function enhances the detectability of typical clusters with BCGs, especially those at higher redshifts with only few galaxies other than the BCG to be included in the apparent magnitude-limited galaxy sample.\n\nThanks to the accurate five-band ($u$,$g$,$r$,$i$,$z$) multi-color photometry in the SDSS [@Yor00], as well as the associated redshift survey for the bright main sample galaxies [@Str02] and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs, @Eis01), it is now also possible to retrieve redshift information for most of the galaxies that we are going to use in construction of the SDSS cluster catalog, either photometrically or spectroscopically. For real SDSS data currently available from DR5, we find that galaxies with valid photometric redshift estimates make up more than $96\\%$ of the whole sample in the imaging data, within which about $1\\%$, mostly bright, red galaxies, have matched spectroscopic measurements from redshift surveys. Not surprisingly, the inclusion of galaxy redshift estimates greatly improves the accuracy of the cluster redshift determinations and significantly mitigates projection effects, thus allowing the detection of much poorer systems than possible in previous work with no redshift measurements.\n\nThe uncertainties of galaxy redshifts are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions in the 2$\\half$-D and 3-D cases, where in terms of the $f(z)$ function in equation (5) we have\n\n$$f(z_k) = {\\exp\\left[-(z_i-z_k)^2/2\\sigma_{z_i}^2\\right] \\over \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{z_i}}.$$\n\nFor galaxies with computed photometric redshifts (described below), we add to the cluster galaxy density model a third subfilter based on the distribution of derived redshift uncertainties in the form of a combination of multiple Gaussian modes. These error estimates are obtained by calibrating photometric redshifts with the real redshifts in the SDSS spectroscopic galaxy sample and redshifts for other fainter (but smaller) overlapping surveys. The analysis is done for red and blue galaxies separately using the color separator by @Strv01, and it is found that a model using Gaussian modes with proper weights assigned generally provides a good description of the bias and scatter in the photometric redshifts for galaxies of both spectral types and in different apparent magnitude bins. Some of the results are shown in §\\[sec:Simulation\\].\n\nIn the 3-D case where spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies are measured, we smooth them in Gaussians with assigned cluster velocity dispersions that vary in the range from $400$ km s$^{-1}$ (proper) for poorer clusters to $1200$ km s$^{-1}$ (proper) for the richest systems in the selected cluster sample, according to several discrete estimated richness classes. The same procedure as outlined in the previous paragraph for photometric redshifts is applied to include this redshift filter in the galaxy density model.\n\nIn addition, there are galaxies we find that either have invalid photometric redshifts computed or fall into the redshift and magnitude range where no good calibrations are available. Such galaxies, which are currently about $3\\%$-$5\\%$ of the whole sample, are assumed to have no redshift estimates and therefore no constraining filter. Hence we set up for each galaxy the appropriate scenario that adapts the matched filter algorithm to galaxy redshift estimates with varied accuracy.\n\nFinally, of course, we fit an overall amplitude, which represents the cluster richness. Since its size, shape and redshift are all determined at this point, we can express the amplitude however we like in physical terms. We have chosen to use the total luminosity within $r_{200}$ expressed as a multiple of $L^*$ (evolved to the relevant redshift using 1.6 mags of luminosity evolution per unit redshift), which we denote as $\\Lambda_{200}$.\n\nImplementation {#sec:Implementation}\n--------------\n\nImplementation of the matched filter algorithm starts with reading the galaxy catalog. For each galaxy $i$ in the sample, we read in the positions $\\alpha_i$, $\\delta_i$, the extinction-corrected five-band apparent magnitudes and their errors, and the redshift $z_i$ if it has a matched spectrum. Using the flux and color information, we compute a photometric redshift estimate using a neural network technique by [@Lin07] as well as $k$-corrections and estimated rest-frame colors for each galaxy, which we add as input to the cluster-finding algorithm.\n\nThe next step is to define the cluster model we adopt for the filters, including the surface density profile $\\Sigma_c(r)$, the luminosity function $\\phi(M)$, and the assumed Gaussian modes of photometric redshift uncertainties. The field density model $P_f(m,z)$ is constructed from global number counts of the surveyed background galaxy distributions as a function of magnitude and redshift, as shown in equation (4). We then incorporate these models into the Poisson likelihood functions as discussed above.\n\nTo map the likelihood distributions of the surveyed area, we grid the sky using the Healpix package of [@Gor05] which provides a useful hierarchical pixelization scheme of equal-area pixels. In @Kep99, the authors choose galaxy positions on an adaptive grid in calculating the likelihoods instead of the uniform grids used in the previous matched filter codes [@Pos96], so that sufficient resolution in the high density regions is ensured while saving computational time and memory for less dense regions. We follow this procedure and evaluate the likelihood functions at every galaxy position to locate the peaks in the map as possible cluster centers. The cluster richness is optimized over the whole redshift range of our search at intervals that finally adapt to $\\delta z=0.001$, and for a set of trial cluster scale radii ($r_c$) at $10$ kpc $h^{-1}$ steps. The derived quantities for best fit cluster richness, redshift and scale length thus correspond to the parameters that maximize the likelihood function at the grid position or candidate cluster center.\n\nThis algorithm possesses several new features. First, the cluster algorithm is fully adaptive to 2-D, 2$\\half$-D and 3-D case in the optical surveys, and can deal with data with these different attributes simultaneously. It can easily accommodate the galaxy redshifts with uncertainties in any forms and distributions, from purely single-band imaging data to a complete spectroscopic redshift survey, and works well for the intermediate case where photometric redshifts are estimated from multi-band color information. Projection effects from foreground–background contamination, which have been a long-standing problem for optically-selected clusters, are largely suppressed. This allows the detection of even poorer systems at high redshift, and shows great potential for current and future large, deeper surveys in the optical band. Second, the current adaptive matched filter used a single Poisson statistics in the likelihood analysis, compared to the two-step approach in @Kep99, which uses a “coarse” filter based on Gaussian likelihood for pre-selection of clusters. We write our code in Fortran-90 and by careful arrangement in computations and setting up the quick link search, the optimization of the Poisson likelihood through the whole process is now affordable in the sense of execution time and memory. For a survey field of $\\sim300$ deg$^2$, which is comparable to a typical SDSS stripe [@Yor00], the modified adaptive matched filter algorithm requires around 900 megabytes of memory and takes about 30 hours for a single run using one dual-processor node in a Linux Beowulf cluster with 3.06 GHz clock speed each. With no assumption necessary about sufficiently many galaxies inside each virtual bin as is necessary in the Gaussian case, the Poisson statistics remains robust in the common situation where there are too few galaxies in each cell for Gaussian statistics to apply. Third, as discussed in @Whi02 and @Koc03, the current density model explicitly includes the effect of previously found clusters on the global likelihood function. The procedure automatically separates overlapping clusters and avoids multiple detections of the same system in the overdensity regions, somewhat similar to the CLEAN method used in radio astronomy to produce maps [@Hog74; @Sch78]. We do not need to do extra cluster de-blending work afterwards. Finally, as discussed earlier, our approach to maximizing the likelihood differs from most previous cluster-finding techniques that choose a fixed cluster scale or search radius. We optimize the core radius for each individual cluster, and the cluster richness is computed within a virial radius which is determined from galaxy overdensities. This provides insights about the virial mass of such gravitational systems defined by density contrast and better corresponds to what is done in theoretical treatments.\n\nTests on Mock Galaxy Catalogs {#sec:Simulation}\n=============================\n\nTo evaluate the completeness and purity (false positive rate) of our cluster sample, as well as to assess the how well our measured cluster properties correspond to the properties of the underlying dark matter halos, we have run the matched-filter algorithm on a mock galaxy catalog generated from a realistic cosmological N-body simulation. Because of the large redshift range we are trying to probe, it is important to do this with as large a simulation volume as possible. In addition, because we seek here to test the behavior of our algorithm using a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, it is useful to have a realistic galaxy population in both clusters and the field, with luminosities, colors, and the relation between these quantities and environment that are a good match to SDSS data. Here we have used a mock catalog based on a method namely ADDGALS (Adding Density-Determined Galaxies to Lightcone Simulations) (@Wec04 and in preparation, 2007), which is designed to model relatively bright galaxies in large volume simulations.\n\nThe underlying dark matter simulation used here tracks $10^9$ particles of mass $2.25\\times10^{12} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ in a periodic cubic volume with side length of $3 h^{-1}$ Gpc, using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\\Omega_m=0.3$, $\\sigma_8=0.9$, and $h=0.7$ [the Hubble Volume simulation; @Evr02]. Halos are identified for masses above $2.7\\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_\\odot$. Data are collected on the past light cone of an observer at the center of the volume. The size of the simulation enables the creation of a full-sky survey out to redshift of $z=0.58$, and is thus suited to testing our cluster-finding algorithm out to high redshifts using the SDSS imaging data.\n\nGalaxies are connected to individual dark matter particles on this simulated light-cone, subject to several empirical constraints. The resolution of the simulation allows the mock catalog to include galaxies brighter than about 0.4$L^*$; the number of galaxies of a given brightness placed within the simulation is determined by drawing galaxies from the SDSS galaxy luminosity function [@Bla03], with 1.6 mags of luminosity evolution assumed per unit redshift (the same assumption is made by our cluster finding algorithm). The choice of which particle these galaxies are assigned to is determined by relating the particle overdensities (on a mass scale of $\\sim 1e13 M_{\\odot}$) to the two-point correlation function of the particles; these particles are then chosen to reproduce the luminosity-dependent correlation function as measured in the SDSS by @Zeh04.\n\nFinally, colors are assigned to each galaxy by measuring their local galaxy density (here, the fifth nearest neighbor within a redshift slice), and assigning to them the colors of a real SDSS galaxy with similar luminosity and local density. The local density measure for SDSS galaxies is taken from a volume-limited sample of the CMU-Pitt DR4 Value Added Catalog. This method produces mock galaxy catalogs that reproduces the luminosity and color correlation function of the real sky. The created mock galaxy sample therefore provides a unique tool to assess the performance of the SDSS cluster-finding algorithms in terms of completeness and purity, as well as how the observables of the detected clusters correspond to dark matter halos assuming galaxy clusters do trace the underlying halo population in the universe.\n\nSince precise spectroscopic redshift measurements are only available for the SDSS main sample galaxies [@Str02] and LRGs [@Eis01], we must use photometric redshift estimates for most of the galaxies. In order to accurately reproduce this scenario in the simulations, we scatter the given redshifts of mock galaxies according to the error distributions of photometric redshift estimates, which are obtained by calibrating a sample of $\\sim$140,000 SDSS photometric redshifts to their known corresponding spectroscopic measurements coming from the SDSS spectroscopic survey and various other sources such as CNOC2 [@Yee00], CFRS [@Lil95a], DEEP [@Wei05], and 2SLAQ LRG [@Pad05]. The photometric redshifts were computed using a neural network technique by [@Lin07] and in preparation; see also the short discussion in the SDSS DR5 data release paper, [@AMc07]. The comparison between calculated photometric redshifts and measured spectroscopic redshifts is shown in Figure 1 for both the red and blue galaxy samples. The distributions of sampled redshift uncertainties are derived for different magnitude and redshift bins, and found to be well described by a combination of multiple Gaussian fits as shown in Figure 2 for examples. The resulted fitting parameters are used for the scattering of mock galaxy redshifts in the simulation. In the case of applying the cluster-finding technique to the real SDSS data, however, instead of deriving “empirical” error estimates collectively, we would use the photo-z errors that are computed based on the Nearest Neighbor Error estimate method (NNE) [@Lin07], which makes it possible to get an estimate of the error for each individual object. This would better constrain the photometric redshift uncertainty, especially for galaxy samples with photo-z errors depending strongly on magnitudes and the actual redshifts. We find the computed errors correspond reasonably well with the empirical ones derived from statistics, with exceptions only for the catastrophic objects. More details would be discussed in a subsequent paper on the application of the modified adaptive matched-filter technique with SDSS data.\n\nTo summarize, the implementation of simulating the observed galaxy redshifts in the mock sample proceeds as follows: for galaxies that satisfy the SDSS spectroscopic target selection criteria we take the given galaxy redshifts as spectroscopic measurements, while for the rest of the sample we use the scattered redshifts to mimic the photometric redshift estimates. As discussed above in §\\[sec:Algorithm\\], there are a few percent of such galaxies that fall into the redshift and magnitude ranges where we find no good calibrations are available. For these galaxies we just treat them as if there is no redshift information at all to put into the algorithm. We also impose to the mock galaxy catalog an apparent magnitude cut ($r<21$) as we intend to adopt in the SDSS imaging sample. The procedure described above thus provides the a mock catalog with the most similar characteristics to the SDSS survey and it will allow us to explore the performance of the cluster-finding algorithm on real SDSS data.\n\nThe modified matched filter algorithm is then run on the mock galaxy catalog, and the detected clusters are compared with matched known halos given in the simulation. We find that the matches are generally robust against details of the matching techniques, as pointed out by @Mil05 [although see also the discussion of various matching algorithms in @Roz07]. Here we adopt a matching criterion of projected separation between the detection and the candidate halo within the virial radius $r_{200}$ and redshift difference $\\Delta z<0.05$. To evaluate completeness of the cluster sample, we match each dark halo to the nearest detected cluster within the projected cluster $r_{200}$ and $\\Delta z$ of 0.05, while in measurement of purity, we match clusters to their corresponding halos applying the same criteria. In the case of multiple matches which are possible for above matching algorithms, we simply assign the most massive halo within the searching space as the real match. Other methods have also been tried in efforts to refine the matching process, but no significant changes are found in the final results.\n\nResults and Discussions {#sec:Results}\n=======================\n\nIn this section we present the results of running the modified adaptive matched-filter algorithm on the simulation-based mock catalogs. These include the completeness and purity check of the detected cluster sample, the derived cluster properties such as estimated redshift and richness, and the expected scaling relations that would link the observed clusters to true halo distributions.\n\nCompleteness and Purity Check {#sec:Completeness}\n-----------------------------\n\nWe define the completeness $C$ of the selected cluster sample as a cumulative function of $M_{200}$, the mass within the virial radius inside which the overdensity is 200 times the critical density:\n\n$$C(M_{200}) = {N_{found} \\over \n    N_{total} }$$\n\nwhere $N_{found}$ is the number of halos with mass greater than $M_{200}$ matched to clusters and $N_{total} $ is the total number of halos above that mass.\n\nFigure 3 shows the completeness of the detected cluster sample as a function of redshift and the virial mass of matched dark matter halos, respectively. The cluster sample, which has a richness cut at $\\Lambda_{200} > 20$, is over $95\\%$ complete for objects with $M_{200} > 2.0\\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ and $\\sim85\\%$ complete for objects with masses above $1.0\\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ in the redshift range of $0.05<z<0.45$. As we will find in the subsequent discussion of cluster scaling relations, the richness cut we impose on the cluster sample contributes to some of the incompleteness for less massive objects because of the large scatter in the cluster richness-mass relation; many of the matched clusters at $\\sim 1.0\\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ are simply scattered below the richness cut and thus not counted to compute the completeness. This can be for sure relieved by lowering the richness cut of the cluster sample, although we choose to stick to this cut for the purity considerations below.\n\nAlso from Figure 3a, the completeness level of the cluster sample remains almost flat out to $z\\sim0.45$, beyond which it suffers a significant decline. This is at least partly due to the volume limit of the mock catalog which only extends to $z=0.58$. When we scatter the given galaxy redshifts with photometric redshift errors, which become large around $z\\sim0.5$, many of the galaxies near the far edge of the light cone are scattered away while fewer galaxies would be shifted into that range, since they are absent from the simulation. The apparent magnitude cut we have applied to the mock galaxy sample may also contribute to incompleteness at high redshift. Taking into consideration the necessary $k$-corrections, the galaxy sample is no longer complete down to the luminosity of $0.4 L^*$, which is the limit assumed throughout the simulation tests. The matched filter therefore loses some power in detecting less rich systems at redshifts of $z\\sim0.5$ and beyond since many fewer galaxies would be bright enough to be observable at that distance in the current survey. We have not investigated these effects in detail, though the onset of clear incompleteness corresponds well to the distance at which they become important.\n\nWe similarly define the purity P of the selected cluster sample as a cumulative function of cluster richness $\\Lambda_{200}$ which is the total cluster luminosity in units of $L^*$ inside its virial radius $r_{200}$\n\n$$P(\\Lambda_{200}) = { N_{match} \\over \n    N_{tot,\\Lambda}},$$\n\nwhere $ N_{match} $ is the number of clusters with richness greater than $\\Lambda_{200}$ matched to halos and $N_{tot,\\Lambda}$ is the total number of clusters with richness above $\\Lambda_{200}$.\n\nThe results of the purity check for the obtained cluster catalog are shown in Figure 4. The sample is over $95\\%$ pure for clusters with $\\Lambda_{200} > 30$ and around $90\\%$ pure for clusters with $\\Lambda_{200} > 20$ over the whole redshift range out to $z\\sim0.45$. As will be shown in the richness-mass relationship below, these two thresholds in richness correspond to $M_{200} \\sim 6.0\\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ and $M_{200} \\sim 4.0\\times10^{13} h^{-1} \nM_\\odot$, respectively. It is worth to be noted that the lower purity for $\\Lambda_{200} > 20$ is clearly going to be affected by halo incompleteness in the simulation, since some of the matched halos for this richness will fall below the mass resolution of the halo catalog, which means the purity we have derived above is in fact probably a lower limit, in similar logic to the completeness arguments.\n\nTo ensure a reasonably high purity of selected clusters, we therefore apply a $\\Lambda_{200} > 20$ cut for the cluster catalog, which is used for analysis of completeness as well as cluster derived properties and scaling relations. The purity measurement shows a slight but notable uptrend in the last redshift bin of $z\\sim0.45-0.5$, which could be similarly explained by the arguments above in the completeness discussions. This reflects a shift in the richness-mass scaling relation at high redshift end where clusters with the same richness measurements may correspond to actually richer and more massive systems because of the under-representation of galaxies that are observable in that redshift range. It is therefore wise to limit the current cluster catalog to a redshift of $z=0.45$ in order to extract a uniform sample for statistical use, though the catalog using real SDSS data may well go deeper reliably.\n\nDerived Cluster Properties and Scaling Relations {#sec:Scaling}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAs is discussed in §\\[sec:Algorithm\\], for each selected cluster a redshift estimate is found for the system by the matched filter that optimizes the detection likelihood at the given galaxy position as cluster center. This measurement is then taken as the estimated redshift for the cluster. Since all the halos have known redshifts in the simulation, by matching the detected clusters to halos following the procedure described in §\\[sec:Simulation\\] we can compare the derived cluster redshifts with the true redshifts of associated halos.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the comparison between estimated cluster redshifts and known halo redshifts. For clusters with redshifts below $z=0.25$ where spectroscopic redshift measurements are often available for member galaxies, the derived cluster redshift estimates precisely reproduce the true redshifts of corresponding dark halos. The inclusion of spectroscopic information of input galaxies markedly sharpens the cluster detection likelihood in the line-of-sight dimension and thus provides accurate measurements of the cluster redshifts. In the higher redshift range where spectroscopic measurements become rare and photometric estimates dominate, the plot illustrates a larger dispersion while the matched filter still gives robust determinations of cluster redshifts even with only photometric galaxy redshift information for inputs. We find that the accuracy of the redshift estimates does incease with cluster richness as expected, which is albeit mostly accounted by higher fraction of cluster galaxy members with spectroscopic measurements inside these systems. There is a slight uptrend bias seen at the redshift of $z\\sim0.45$, which we see as a similar indication of incompleteness of the input galaxy sample near the high end of the redshift range for this mock catalog because of the volume limit and magnitude cut. The estimated cluster redshift determined from maximum likelihood tends to drift towards smaller values in some cases since the detection probability at higher redshift is suppressed by such effects. We also note the existence of a few serious outliers, which probably represent the occasional scenario when there exists a mismatch between relevant clusters and dark halos due to the projection effects or false positive detections.\n\nThe normalized cluster richnesses $\\Lambda_{200}$ are also compared with the virial mass $M_{200}$ of matched halos. The results are shown in Figure 6. We find that the richness-mass scaling relation follows\n\n$$\\Lambda_{200} = (47.2\\pm4.1)\\times \\left( M_{200}  \\over {10^{14} h^{-1} M_\\odot} \\right )^{1.03\\pm0.04} ,$$\n\nwhich is roughly a linear fit. Whether this is correct or not, clearly, depends upon the details of the simulation input, and the way the simulation was constructed gives no easy clue to what the results should be. What is important in this test, however, is that we recover what is present in the simulations, not what might or might not be present in the real universe. To that end, we have constructed three more plots. The first, Figure 7, compares the cluster richness determined by the present algorithm with the total three dimensional luminosity of the matched halos; the agreement is very good, with no bias evident at either the sparse or the rich end. Given this agreement and the results of Figure 6, the next plot, Figure 8, of the 3-D halo luminosity vs the 3-D halo mass, contains no surprises. The simulated halo mass is, in fact, linear with its total luminosity, and we recover this relationship.\n\nFigure 9 compares the derived cluster virial radius $r_{200}$ from the cluster-finding algorithm and the $r_{200}$ determined from 3-dimensional galaxy overdensities. The agreement is excellent at small virial radii, though there is a strong hint that the algorithm slightly overestimates large virial radii, by seven percent or thereabouts. This is almost certainly due to the assumption of a single NFW profile to describe the cluster; neighboring halos have rather different effects in the cylinder to which the algorithm is sensitive and the corresponding sphere in the simulations, but it is gratifying that the effects are this small. These results further justify our choice to refer our richness measurements to the commonly-used virial radius determined from galaxy overdensities.\n\nIt is, however, clear that the scatter in the richness–mass relation derived from the cluster finding algorithm (Figure 6) is somewhat larger than that of the intrinsic richeness-mass relation in the simulations (Figure 8), which can be read as an indication of complications in the cluster-halo matching process, e.g., the inevitable difference between the cluster finder and halo finder regarding fragmentation and merging, differing shapes between the galaxy and mass distributions, and, even further, the variable mass-to-light ratios inside the systems incorporated in the current dark matter simulations. Despite these intrinsic dispersions, the richness-mass scaling relation shows a strong linear correspondence between the observables and the mass, and thus makes it possible to extract the true halo distribution in the Universe from the observed cluster abundance and correlation functions. It is important to note that the simulation from which the catalog was made is a dark-matter-only simulation, and thus effects which may well exist in real clusters and can affect the baryon fraction in the intracluster gas and galaxies (see, for example, [@Kra05]) as a function of cluster mass are absent here, but the fact that we recover the relation found from input 3-D simulations, here just linear, indicates that we should be able to investigate a possibly more complex relationship in the real universe.\n\nConclusions {#sec:Conclusion}\n===========\n\nWe present a modified matched filter algorithm which is designed to construct a comprehensive cluster catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but is applicable to any deep photometric survey. The technique is fully adaptive to 2-D, 2$\\half$-D and 3-D optical surveys, as well as to various cluster scales and substructures.\n\nThe cluster-finding algorithm has been tested against a realistic mock SDSS catalog from a large N-body simulation. The results suggest that the selected cluster sample is $\\sim 85\\%$ complete and over $90\\%$ pure for systems more massive than $1.0\\times10^{14} h^{-1}$ M$_\\odot$ with redshifts up to $z=0.45$. The estimated cluster redshifts derived from maximum likelihood analysis show small errors with $\\Delta z < 0.01$, and the normalized cluster richness measurements fit linearly with the virial mass of matched halos, the correct relation in this simulation. This offers hope that the (very likely nonlinear) relation between richness and halo mass which exists in the real universe can be investigated with these techniques.\n\nF.D. thanks H. Lin, H.
